1607,"It seems like the ECB and the ICC haven't put much effort into planning this CWC and it's quite upsetting considering the fact that having the opportunity to host the world cup is an honour and the host nation is responsible for promoting the sport


The opening ceremony was lacklustre. Looking at the last 2 world cups they had jam packed arenas with a sound and light show with good live music.

England had a lacklustre 'party' which was a bit miserable. I found it quite offensive when they decided to only interview a few captains after bringing them on stage, with the majority of them being ignored. I found this quite offensive to fans of the other nations who's captains were just left out.

The live music definitely not up to par. John Newman's moaning of Feel the Love didn't get the crowd riling up. It would have been a lot nicer if they had bagpipes playing or other musical and dancing acts such as the ones we saw in CWC 11 and 15.

The batting 60 second competition was really boring and the whole show was ruined by the fact that the organizers were unable to ensure that there weren't any technical difficulties.

In terms of ticketing and sales the CWC ticket portal is lagging and the UI is horrendous. You cannot choose which stand and which seats you'd like to choose. Instead you have to choose between 4 classes of tickets and you are only told where you have been assigned seats after you reach your basket and there is no way to change the assigned seats. There is no dedicated phone number to enquire about ticket sales and often the tickets which are marketed as available aren't actually available as it constantly says tickets not found. Het days later they still advertise the tickets as unsold.

(The ticket pricing is horrendous as well) 


I've bought tickets over a month ago and I was told that they would reach me a minimum of 6 weeks before the match and there aren't even 4 weeks left for the match to begin. There are reports all over the news of fans not recieving their tickets and having to queue in the box office to receive their tickets on the day itself.


It's honestly such a shame that the ECB and the ICC haven't done a better job of organising themselves in order to make this CWC as enjoyable as possible for the fans and as beneficial to the game in terms of publicity and attracting a new fanbase.

1678,"Well, this is an easy question isn’t it? Whoever hit the Most Sixes is the Greatest. Duh. That player hit more Sixes than anyone ever, how can they not be the greatest? Let’s have a look who it is…

1. Shahid Afridi – **351** Sixes in 398 Matches
2. CH Gayle – **314** Sixes in 289 Matches
3. ST Jayasuriya – **270** Sixes in 445 Matches
4. MS Dhoni – **224** Sixes in 341 Matches
5. RG Sharma – **218** Sixes in 398 Matches
6. AB de Villiers – **204** Sixes in 228 Matches
7. BB McCullum – **200** Sixes in 260 Matches
8. SR Tendulkar – **195** Sixes in 463 Matches
9. SC Ganguly – **190** Sixes in 311 Matches
10. EJG Morgan – **189** Sixes in 222 Matches
11. MJ Guptill – **164** Sixes in 169 Matches
12. RT Ponting – **162** Sixes in 375 Matches
13. Yuvraj Singh – **155** Sixes in 304 Matches
14. CL Cairns – **153** Sixes in 215 Matches
15. AC Gilchrist – **149** Sixes in 287 Matches

Shahid Afridi comfortably leads this category, although Gayle could overtake him if he has a good world cup. All the big names are all there; de Villiers, McCullum, Sachin, Ponting. I wouldn’t say there are too many surprises in this list.

So there you have it Shahid Afridi is the greatest six hitt-, wait hang on a minute. Ganguly has played 90 more matches, yet only scored one more six than Morgan… Is he really a greater six hitter than Morgan?

What if I considered how many sixes were hit per innings? And also how many balls it took per six, to consider the batsmen who come in lower down the order and don’t face as many balls per innings. Yes ok that could be a good idea, but wait does that mean I need to do more analysis? Yes? Ugh alright then, here we go.

Let’s have a look at Sixes per innings, with a minimum of 30 sixes hit:

1. SO Hetmyer – **1.50** Sixes per innings
2. HH Pandya – **1.24** Sixes per innings
3. AD Russell – **1.23** Sixes per innings
4. CJ Anderson – **1.22** Sixes per innings
5. MP Stoinis – **1.16** Sixes per innings
6. KA Pollard – **1.16** Sixes per innings
7. CH Gayle – **1.11** Sixes per innings
8. Rizwan Cheema – **1.09** Sixes per innings
9. RG Sharma – **1.09** Sixes per innings
10. JC Buttler – **1.08** Sixes per innings
11. YK Pathan – **1.05** Sixes per innings
12. Najibullah Zadran – **1.02** Sixes per innings
13. MJ Guptill – **0.99** Sixes per innings
14. R Powell – **0.97** Sixes per innings
15. GJ Maxwell – **0.97** Sixes per innings

Well this measure is definitely better. All these players are well-known for their big hitting, and Hetmyer especially has burst onto the scene and really shown his batting prowess. Maybe you’d expect to see de Villiers (17th with 0.94) and McCullum (25th with 0.88) in the top fifteen to name a few but they are both still up there, and it is worth mentioning that they were much better than just ‘power players’ like the names above. For what it's worth, Rahul Dravid takes bottom spot, 196th with a measly 0.13 sixes per innings.

Now let’s look at Balls per Six, which will better accommodate the lower order batsmen who have less balls to construct an innings, again minimum 30 sixes hit:

1. AD Russell – **14.2** Balls per Six
2. YK Pathan – **16.6** Balls per Six
3. HH Pandya – **17.4** Balls per Six
4. CJ Anderson – **18.5** Balls per Six
5. Rizwan Cheema – **19.6** Balls per Six
6. Shahid Afridi – **19.6** Balls per Six
7. DJG Sammy – **22.3** Balls per Six
8. KA Pollard – **22.4** Balls per Six
9. SO Hetmyer – **22.3** Balls per Six
10. BL Cairns – **23.0** Balls per Six
11. NLTC Perera – **23.9** Balls per Six
12. JC Buttler – **25.2** Balls per Six
13. GJ Maxwell – **25.4** Balls per Six
14. DR Smith – **26.3** Balls per Six
15. R Powell – **26.9** Balls per Six

This list is very similar to the Sixes per Innings list, as it should be, but lower order batsman like Russell, Sammy and Perera rise up the list, while good batsman who face a lot of balls, like Gayle, Sharma and Guptill fall down the list. Amid all the change there is one constant. In last again is Dravid with 363.9 Balls per Six, which is impressive in how high that is.

So it seems that Russell and Pandya, who are in the top 3 for both measures are the greatest so that settles that then. Thanks for readi-. Oh hang on again, I’ve just realised something.

Let’s have a look at this graph [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/bs6pkg/sixes_hit_in_odis_from_2000_to_just_before_the/), posted by chance by a random (most likely very handsome) redditor. The graph is for **INDIVIDUAL innings**, and shows that average balls needed to hit a six has fallen from 131 balls in 2000 to 52 balls in 2019 (\*up to CWC 2019), and therefore sixes hit in an average individual innings has increased from 0.24 sixes per individual innings in 2000 to 0.60 in 2019. If you take this further back the values for 1980 and 1990 for Sixes per Innings is 0.14 and 0.27 respectively and for Balls per Six for 1980 and 1990 is 433 and 203 respectively. Therefore you can deduce that Sixes are hit roughly 4 times more often in 2019 compared to 1990.

This very obviously shows that sixes are hit way more often nowadays than previously. It is therefore no surprise that 13 of the top 15 players in the second list and 12 of the top 15 in the third list have played at least one game in the period 2015-2019 which is generally recognised as a period of rising strike rates and massive scores. Here’s a thought, what if I weighted every Six hit in a year by the yearly average and arrive at a number where you could easily differentiate between players.

(This paragraph is a boring formula, scroll down if you don’t want to read.) What I have done, for both the previous Balls and Innings measures, is taken that specific value for a given year and divided by the average figure for that year (so Morgan in 2019 hit 2.38 sixes per innings divided by the average 0.6 gives 3.93). Then take that value and multiply it by innings played in the year/ total innings played. (So for Morgan, it would be 3.93\*(8/207) = 0.15). You do this for all years that the batsmen played and Sum all the values. The final value for Morgan is 2.08. This means that if an average batsman played exactly the same number of innings in those years as Morgan, then Morgan would hit 2.08 times more Sixes than the average batsman in this period. The exact same calculation is done for Balls per Six, and Morgan’s value here is 1.67, which makes sense, as he is likely to face more balls per innings than the average batsman.

So this should take years into perspective, and looking at Weighted Sixes per innings first, let’s look who came out on top:

1. IVA Richards – **3.64**
2. BL Cairns – **3.21**
3. Rizwan Cheema – **3.19**
4. CG Greenidge – **3.13**
5. KA Pollard – **3.11**
6. YK Pathan – **3.09**
7. CH Gayle – **3.08**
8. AD Russell – **3.02**
9. SO Hetmyer – **2.97**
10. Shahid Afridi – **2.96**
11. RL Powell – **2.94**
12. JM Kemp – **2.93**
13. A Flintoff – **2.88**
14. CL Cairns – **2.73**
15. HH Pandya – **2.67**

This gives a better unbiased look, as at least three batsmen played in each decade from the 1970s. Viv, as everyone knows, was a monster. He hit more than 3.5x more sixes than his average peer and leads the field by a distance. The big hitters of today are still in the top 15, but have been relegated down somewhat, while big hitters of yesteryear like Flintoff, Cairns and Greenidge make an appearance. Now lets check out Weighted Balls per Six, which will most likely reward lower order batsmen who faced less balls:

1. BL Cairns – **12.10**
2. Shahid Afridi – **5.42**
3. YK Pathan – **5.30**
4. AD Russell – **5.21**
5. IT Botham – **4.76**
6. Wasim Akram – **4.71**
7. IVA Richards – **4.56**
8. Rizwan Cheema – **4.41**
9. Kapil Dev – **4.29**
10. RL Powell – **4.16**
11. HH Pandya – **3.78**
12. KA Pollard – **3.60**
13. DJG Sammy – **3.56**
14. DR Smith – **3.53**
15. CJ Anderson – **3.50**

Lance Cairns wins this by an absolute country mile. He hit over 12 times more Sixes than his average peer. To show his incredible ability: in 1983, 145 sixes were hit in 37,464 balls (258 balls per six). Lance hit 21 sixes in 259 balls at a frankly ridiculous rate of 13 balls per six, 21 times better than the average. Looking at the unweighted Sixes per ball, Lance is 10th and was the only player in the top 15 to play in the 70s and 80s and only Shahid Afridi played any ODI cricket before 2003. As predicted, the lower order batsman come to the fore in this table, and the big hitters of today still make an appearance.

Who is the Greatest Six hitter of all time? You could argue Afridi, or Russell, or Viv, but for me it has to be **Lance Cairns**. He hit 41 sixes in 65 innings, back when people didn’t even know what a boundary was. He is 2nd behind Viv in Weighted Sixes per innings despite facing less than 15 balls per average innings. Upon further research, I also found out he named his bat ‘Excalibur’.. I mean come on, if you don’t love him even more now, then you never will.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading, I actually very much enjoyed making this, so I hope you enjoyed reading this. If you have any specific queries about what I could've done a bit different, please comment down below and if you're interested in finding a value for a specific player and where they rank, comment their name and I should be able to tell you their scores :)   Who is the Greatest Six Hitter in ODI Cricket of all time?",t5_2qhe0,sports,"Well, this is an easy question isn’t it? Whoever hit the Most Sixes is the Greatest. Duh. That player hit more Sixes than anyone ever, how can they not be the greatest? Let’s have a look who it is…

1. Shahid Afridi – **351** Sixes in 398 Matches
2. CH Gayle – **314** Sixes in 289 Matches
3. ST Jayasuriya – **270** Sixes in 445 Matches
4. MS Dhoni – **224** Sixes in 341 Matches
5. RG Sharma – **218** Sixes in 398 Matches
6. AB de Villiers – **204** Sixes in 228 Matches
7. BB McCullum – **200** Sixes in 260 Matches
8. SR Tendulkar – **195** Sixes in 463 Matches
9. SC Ganguly – **190** Sixes in 311 Matches
10. EJG Morgan – **189** Sixes in 222 Matches
11. MJ Guptill – **164** Sixes in 169 Matches
12. RT Ponting – **162** Sixes in 375 Matches
13. Yuvraj Singh – **155** Sixes in 304 Matches
14. CL Cairns – **153** Sixes in 215 Matches
15. AC Gilchrist – **149** Sixes in 287 Matches

Shahid Afridi comfortably leads this category, although Gayle could overtake him if he has a good world cup. All the big names are all there; de Villiers, McCullum, Sachin, Ponting. I wouldn’t say there are too many surprises in this list.

So there you have it Shahid Afridi is the greatest six hitt-, wait hang on a minute. Ganguly has played 90 more matches, yet only scored one more six than Morgan… Is he really a greater six hitter than Morgan?

What if I considered how many sixes were hit per innings? And also how many balls it took per six, to consider the batsmen who come in lower down the order and don’t face as many balls per innings. Yes ok that could be a good idea, but wait does that mean I need to do more analysis? Yes? Ugh alright then, here we go.

Let’s have a look at Sixes per innings, with a minimum of 30 sixes hit:

1. SO Hetmyer – **1.50** Sixes per innings
2. HH Pandya – **1.24** Sixes per innings
3. AD Russell – **1.23** Sixes per innings
4. CJ Anderson – **1.22** Sixes per innings
5. MP Stoinis – **1.16** Sixes per innings
6. KA Pollard – **1.16** Sixes per innings
7. CH Gayle – **1.11** Sixes per innings
8. Rizwan Cheema – **1.09** Sixes per innings
9. RG Sharma – **1.09** Sixes per innings
10. JC Buttler – **1.08** Sixes per innings
11. YK Pathan – **1.05** Sixes per innings
12. Najibullah Zadran – **1.02** Sixes per innings
13. MJ Guptill – **0.99** Sixes per innings
14. R Powell – **0.97** Sixes per innings
15. GJ Maxwell – **0.97** Sixes per innings

Well this measure is definitely better. All these players are well-known for their big hitting, and Hetmyer especially has burst onto the scene and really shown his batting prowess. Maybe you’d expect to see de Villiers (17th with 0.94) and McCullum (25th with 0.88) in the top fifteen to name a few but they are both still up there, and it is worth mentioning that they were much better than just ‘power players’ like the names above. For what it's worth, Rahul Dravid takes bottom spot, 196th with a measly 0.13 sixes per innings.

Now let’s look at Balls per Six, which will better accommodate the lower order batsmen who have less balls to construct an innings, again minimum 30 sixes hit:

1. AD Russell – **14.2** Balls per Six
2. YK Pathan – **16.6** Balls per Six
3. HH Pandya – **17.4** Balls per Six
4. CJ Anderson – **18.5** Balls per Six
5. Rizwan Cheema – **19.6** Balls per Six
6. Shahid Afridi – **19.6** Balls per Six
7. DJG Sammy – **22.3** Balls per Six
8. KA Pollard – **22.4** Balls per Six
9. SO Hetmyer – **22.3** Balls per Six
10. BL Cairns – **23.0** Balls per Six
11. NLTC Perera – **23.9** Balls per Six
12. JC Buttler – **25.2** Balls per Six
13. GJ Maxwell – **25.4** Balls per Six
14. DR Smith – **26.3** Balls per Six
15. R Powell – **26.9** Balls per Six

This list is very similar to the Sixes per Innings list, as it should be, but lower order batsman like Russell, Sammy and Perera rise up the list, while good batsman who face a lot of balls, like Gayle, Sharma and Guptill fall down the list. Amid all the change there is one constant. In last again is Dravid with 363.9 Balls per Six, which is impressive in how high that is.

So it seems that Russell and Pandya, who are in the top 3 for both measures are the greatest so that settles that then. Thanks for readi-. Oh hang on again, I’ve just realised something.

Let’s have a look at this graph [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/bs6pkg/sixes_hit_in_odis_from_2000_to_just_before_the/), posted by chance by a random (most likely very handsome) redditor. The graph is for **INDIVIDUAL innings**, and shows that average balls needed to hit a six has fallen from 131 balls in 2000 to 52 balls in 2019 (\*up to CWC 2019), and therefore sixes hit in an average individual innings has increased from 0.24 sixes per individual innings in 2000 to 0.60 in 2019. If you take this further back the values for 1980 and 1990 for Sixes per Innings is 0.14 and 0.27 respectively and for Balls per Six for 1980 and 1990 is 433 and 203 respectively. Therefore you can deduce that Sixes are hit roughly 4 times more often in 2019 compared to 1990.

This very obviously shows that sixes are hit way more often nowadays than previously. It is therefore no surprise that 13 of the top 15 players in the second list and 12 of the top 15 in the third list have played at least one game in the period 2015-2019 which is generally recognised as a period of rising strike rates and massive scores. Here’s a thought, what if I weighted every Six hit in a year by the yearly average and arrive at a number where you could easily differentiate between players.

(This paragraph is a boring formula, scroll down if you don’t want to read.) What I have done, for both the previous Balls and Innings measures, is taken that specific value for a given year and divided by the average figure for that year (so Morgan in 2019 hit 2.38 sixes per innings divided by the average 0.6 gives 3.93). Then take that value and multiply it by innings played in the year/ total innings played. (So for Morgan, it would be 3.93\*(8/207) = 0.15). You do this for all years that the batsmen played and Sum all the values. The final value for Morgan is 2.08. This means that if an average batsman played exactly the same number of innings in those years as Morgan, then Morgan would hit 2.08 times more Sixes than the average batsman in this period. The exact same calculation is done for Balls per Six, and Morgan’s value here is 1.67, which makes sense, as he is likely to face more balls per innings than the average batsman.

So this should take years into perspective, and looking at Weighted Sixes per innings first, let’s look who came out on top:

1. IVA Richards – **3.64**
2. BL Cairns – **3.21**
3. Rizwan Cheema – **3.19**
4. CG Greenidge – **3.13**
5. KA Pollard – **3.11**
6. YK Pathan – **3.09**
7. CH Gayle – **3.08**
8. AD Russell – **3.02**
9. SO Hetmyer – **2.97**
10. Shahid Afridi – **2.96**
11. RL Powell – **2.94**
12. JM Kemp – **2.93**
13. A Flintoff – **2.88**
14. CL Cairns – **2.73**
15. HH Pandya – **2.67**

This gives a better unbiased look, as at least three batsmen played in each decade from the 1970s. Viv, as everyone knows, was a monster. He hit more than 3.5x more sixes than his average peer and leads the field by a distance. The big hitters of today are still in the top 15, but have been relegated down somewhat, while big hitters of yesteryear like Flintoff, Cairns and Greenidge make an appearance. Now lets check out Weighted Balls per Six, which will most likely reward lower order batsmen who faced less balls:

1. BL Cairns – **12.10**
2. Shahid Afridi – **5.42**
3. YK Pathan – **5.30**
4. AD Russell – **5.21**
5. IT Botham – **4.76**
6. Wasim Akram – **4.71**
7. IVA Richards – **4.56**
8. Rizwan Cheema – **4.41**
9. Kapil Dev – **4.29**
10. RL Powell – **4.16**
11. HH Pandya – **3.78**
12. KA Pollard – **3.60**
13. DJG Sammy – **3.56**
14. DR Smith – **3.53**
15. CJ Anderson – **3.50**

Lance Cairns wins this by an absolute country mile. He hit over 12 times more Sixes than his average peer. To show his incredible ability: in 1983, 145 sixes were hit in 37,464 balls (258 balls per six). Lance hit 21 sixes in 259 balls at a frankly ridiculous rate of 13 balls per six, 21 times better than the average. Looking at the unweighted Sixes per ball, Lance is 10th and was the only player in the top 15 to play in the 70s and 80s and only Shahid Afridi played any ODI cricket before 2003. As predicted, the lower order batsman come to the fore in this table, and the big hitters of today still make an appearance.

Who is the Greatest Six hitter of all time? You could argue Afridi, or Russell, or Viv, but for me it has to be **Lance Cairns**. He hit 41 sixes in 65 innings, back when people didn’t even know what a boundary was. He is 2nd behind Viv in Weighted Sixes per innings despite facing less than 15 balls per average innings. Upon further research, I also found out he named his bat ‘Excalibur’.. I mean come on, if you don’t love him even more now, then you never will.

2061,"It's spring, and our local nature center and animal rescue is again desperately trying to tell well-meaning people to leave the fawns alone. Fawns have a natural instinct to stay in one spot and wait all day for their mother to come back. Often the mother leaves the fawn in the morning and won't come back until dusk to feed them. This is natural. Young fawns with their mothers are at more of a risk from predators than hiding on their own. They can't move fast enough to avoid a coyote or dog. As fawns get a little older, they will start to stand up and move around a bit during the day, but they always stay in the same area they were left. This is often when people will see them in their backyard or the field near their house. 

Don't touch the fawn. It's not abandoned. It's mother will come back for it. When people try to ""save"" these fawns it's a very bad thing. Fawns that haven't been bottle trained since birth don't take well to bottles. Many of them will starve to death when they refuse to eat in the house of a well-meaning rescuer. Most animal rescues if you show up with a fawn will tell you to take it back immediately and put it where you found it. It stands a better chance of the mother coming back later that day than being raised by even trained rescuers. 

The same is true for rabbits. If you find a nest of rabbits in your yard just leave them alone. If you see them hopping around the next they're getting closer to the point they'll leave soon, but the mother is still coming to nurse them. Just leave them alone. Also, if your kids do happen to touch a baby rabbit it's an old wive's tale that the mother will reject them.

2106,"**TL;DR: Short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.** 

Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.  

The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail. 

She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.* 

I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing. 

And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad. 

The things I have in mine include: 

\- Survival heating blanket

\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- Whistle

\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- Critical meds and bandages

\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- Compass (if you're able to use it)

\- Paracord

\- Knife

\- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).

Dogs communicate with each other through an elegant and complex system of body language: gestures, postures, movements and facial expressions.

With a little bit of technical elbow grease I put together a complete list of all of these codes with accompanying hyperlinks.

&amp;#x200B;

If the category ""Comedy"" or ""Action Thriller"" doesn't narrow the selection down enough and you are looking for categories such as ""Witty Underdog Movies"" ""Wilderness Survival Documentaries"" or ""Sentimental Dysfunctional-Family Dramas""  this is the list for you.  


As of 6/4/2019 Netflix is only showing 1761 shows and 4091 movies available so of course many of these may not show movies available.  So, if ""Foreign Revenge Musicals"" is your thing, sorry, you may need to check back from time to time.

Take your spoon and eat from the bottom...NOT THE TOP.

**Summary:**

Childhood friends Sasha and Marcus have a falling out and don’t speak for 15 years. But when Sasha, now a celebrity chef in Los Angeles, returns to her hometown of San Francisco to open a new restaurant, she runs into her old pal -- a happily complacent musician still living at home and working for his dad. Though the two are reluctant to reconnect, they soon find the old sparks — and maybe some new ones — are there.

**Summary:**

During a rescue mission in space, Jean Grey is nearly killed when she is hit by a mysterious cosmic force. Once she returns home, this force not only makes her infinitely more powerful, but far more unstable. Wrestling with this entity inside her, Jean unleashes her powers in ways she can neither comprehend nor contain. With Jean spiraling out of control, and hurting the ones she loves most, she begins to unravel the very fabric that holds the X-Men together. Now, with this family falling apart, they must find a way to unite -- not only to save Jean's soul, but to save our very planet from aliens who wish to weaponize this force and rule the galaxy.

First off, Lisbeth is supposed to be this incredible hacker who managed to hack into the NSA and steal the firefall program, but she didn't mask her IP address. Really? Someone with the ability to hack the NSA didnt know to mask their IP address?

Then there's the guy with the hole in his face. A vicious gang dismembered his face, and he doesn't even hesitate to give the journalist information about them. If a highly sophisticated crime syndicate turned my face into swiss cheese, I wouldn't give out any information about them to God himself, but this random journalist walks in and he just starts spilling the beans.

Then there's the fucking kid. He saw his father get killed and an hour later after getting saved by Lisbeth, he stops in the middle of a parking garage while they are looking for a getaway vehicle and stares at a Lamborghini. Really kid? You just saw your father get murked an hour earlier, and now youre mesmerized over a Lamborghini? And lisbeth actually steals it. Instead of taking the nondescript suv, which would have come in handy considering its winter in Sweden and there's a psychotic gang hell bent on finding and murdering you, she actually takes the flashy, low to the ground, sports car. 

Then the kid answers his cell phone at the secret hideout because the caller id showed it was his dad calling. This kid is supposed to be a fucking genius, and he actually believed his dead dad was calling his cell. A genius kid should have realized that the bad guys had his dad's phone and were trying to track to him. I really don't understand how Lisbeth lost at chess to this kid without realizing it. 


Then there's the journalist guy. This guy is desperately searching for the identity of the man trying to kill Lisbeth, and he's getting nowhere, until his lover walks in and mentions that the guy is probably Russian. Then all of a sudden, he grabs a framed magazine from the wall and smashes the glass and turns exactly to the page where the guy's picture is. Really man? It never hit you that it was the same guy featured in your magazine, but knowing that he was possibly Russian is was instantly tipped you off?

I haven't even talked about the dumb scenes like the guy who snapped his leg in half and somehow is still able to walk through the forest with only a limp.

It never hit you that it was the same guy featured in your magazine, but knowing that he was possibly Russian is was instantly tipped you off?

I haven't even talked about the dumb scenes like the guy who snapped his leg in half and somehow is still able to walk through the forest with only a limp.

&gt; ""X-Men"" mutant doesn't start the fire

-[Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-dark-phoenix-x-men-movie-review-0604-story.html)

&gt; The first couple of “X-Men” movies in the 2000s, and more recently “X-Men: First Class” and “Logan,” set the standard for what this long-running franchise could and should do. Compared to that ilk, “Dark Phoenix” simply flames out.

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/06/05/dark-phoenix-review-xmen-last-stand-forgettable-effort/1326884001/)

&gt; “Dark Phoenix,” on the other hand, is designed to avoid pushing any buttons. Or doing much of anything else, for that matter. It just sort of happens, and not even the movie itself seems to know why. “Dark Phoenix” promises that the X-Men will rise from the ashes — that Jean Grey will be reborn from her own pain — but there’s no use holding your breath for a miracle; this entire franchise feels like it’s already been interred.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/06/dark-phoenix-review-x-men-sophie-turner-1202147248/): D

&gt; Compared to the conclusions of other major franchises — the most recent being Avengers: Endgame — this one seems distinctly minor-league. The men who have anchored most of the X-Men outings are just spinning their wheels here, and while Jean's central dilemma is certainly dramatic enough, and is most closely entwined with the actions of two other women, what should have registered as genuinely powerful instead plays out in a pretty low-key way. In no way does this feel like a fulsome, satisfying destination to a journey that started two decades ago and logged about 30 hours in the telling.

-[Todd McCarthy, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/dark-phoenix-review-1215806)

&gt; There’s a cheesiness that Kinberg brings to his imagery that recalls the original X-Men movies, with all of their faults and strengths. That sentimentality ultimately doesn’t pay off because of the lackluster performances of the cast and the shoddy scaffolding of the first two acts. Still, Dark Phoenix is not as much trainwreck as it is a slow-moving car collision that ends up screeching to a halt right before it scratches the bumper in front of it. No bang, no explosion, just a limp sense of finality. In a sense, Dark Phoenix is the perfect median of the massively uneven X-Men franchise: a middle-of-the-road superhero film that will be remembered for its lost potential.

-[Hoai-Tran Bui, /FILM](https://www.slashfilm.com/dark-phoenix-review/): 6/10

&gt; I’ll always be an X-Men fan since the 90s cartoon was my gateway to geekery, but Dark Phoenix shows that this franchise has made too many miscalculations to continue as it is. Even setting aside the messy continuity, why did these movies need to jump forward a decade with every installment? Why adapt “The Dark Phoenix Saga” if the character relationships haven’t been properly established? What makes an X-Men movie unique when the world now has The Avengers? These questions were never really answered, and so the current X-Men series closes not with triumph but with a shrug (I’m inclined to believe that the upcoming New Mutants, which doesn’t share any cast members with the X-Men saga proper, will get buried on Hulu or Disney+). When Marvel Studios inevitably reboots X-Men, a movie like Dark Phoenix will be a forgotten relic. The characters and their world deserve better, but we’ll have to wait until their next evolution.

-[Matt Goldberg, Collider](http://collider.com/dark-phoenix-review/): D

&gt; Dark Phoenix is ultimately yet another fumbled take on the classic saga from the Marvel Comics, albeit one without the side plots of The Last Stand. Add to it a jarringly uneven latter half and some underdeveloped cosmic villains, and Dark Phoenix is fortunate to have not fully ended the X-Men’s current big screen run on a completely down note. While the MCU may prove better suited to give so many of these beloved mutant characters the rich dimension and care they deserve, the property itself deservedly needs a good long rest before the X-Men return to the screen.

&gt; The point of a phoenix, dark or otherwise, is that it rises from the flames. But these are the flames in which this franchise has finally gone down.

&gt; Given an eight year head start on rival superhero franchise, the Avengers, but with ten fewer films under its belt, the X-Men series suffers from creative decisions which have resulted in a confused and contradictory patchwork of cast changes, multiple timelines and repetitive narratives. This twelfth X-Men yarn is a sombre and plodding retread of the series' 2006 third instalment, X-Men: The Last Stand, and feels at all times like a rehashed greatest hits package of uninspired action scenes.

&gt; It would be wonderful to report that “Dark Phoenix” was an impressive send-off to this long-running franchise (especially since the next film, “New Mutants,” isn’t coming out anytime soon). In a strange way, it might have been preferable if this was the most embarrassing film in the series, since at least then there’d be a reason to remember it. Instead it’s just a disappointingly average superhero flick, with a familiar story, disinterested actors, some cool action sequences, and a whole lot of missed opportunities.

-[William Bibbiani, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/dark-phoenix-film-review-x-men-2019/)

&gt; Its atrocious, expository dialogue, cumbersome plot, whiplashing character motivations, unintentionally funny moments, and often corny costumes, ensures, “Dark Phoenix” will be remembered in the annals of mediocre movies (and for somehow utterly wasting Jessica Chastain, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and James McAvoy in the same film). But there is a kernel of what it could have been, and in case you’re wondering it’s not quite the nadir of the series. Toying with ideas of identity and destiny that it telegraphs in spoon-feeding voiceover, “Dark Phoenix” wants to be about who we are and those who aren’t afforded that choice— positing that Jean Grey might be destined for greatness or fated to be a monster, but personal agency of who she truly is, has never been in her control. It’s admirable material on paper, but it’s also just layers of stuff that’s meaningless and empty. And so imagine a story about an arrogant movie that believes its psychologically complex, but ultimately can’t see itself for the shallow superhero movie it truly is.

2566,"1. Steven Spielberg left because he shifted his production company DreamWorks from Paramount to Disney. Christopher Nolan was recommended to the studio by Jonathan Nolan, his brother, who was the writer for the film.


2. Here is a short summary of the script of the Spielberg version:

The original script of the Steven Spielberg version of this movie depicts an almost entirely different movie. Some examples include Murph being a boy, no humans are first sent into space (probes are) and a probe leads Cooper to the hidden N.A.S.A. base, which is on a remote island in California where Brand and Cooper deep-sea dive for parts. Also, the robots are much more human-like, featuring hands and shoulders. TARS is sucked into space early on when the ship gets stuck between two black holes (Gargantua and Pantagruel, named for two French mythical giants) immediately after entering the wormhole. Afterward, the crew, including an additional member named Roth, only visit the ice planet, where they discover that a Chinese mission had been there around thirty years prior, and seemed to have vanished, until it is learned that they were killed by the radiation of a neutron star. The crew falls through the ice into an entirely different ecosystem with a living rearranging forest and colonial organisms that fight each other every night, compounding into larger organisms to reach a higher spot closer to the ice ""sky"" for sunlight in the day. After searching the area, they find an abandoned Chinese camp with an experimental black box that can control gravity, and are then discovered by Chinese robots who sabotage their return home with the box. The crew orbits a black hole for hundreds of Earth years before entering a second wormhole where they interact directly with the fifth dimension bulk beings who lead them to a four thousand-year-old space station built by the Chinese that's only a few hundred years old, due to space-time relativity, powered by a captured mini black hole that views galaxies as flat lines of light. The Chinese have built thousands of worm holes, and tried to travel back in time with the gravity technology to save all of Earth, but died in the process. Cooper returns to Earth, in the year 2230, to find a barren land with ice storms. He sits down prepared to die in the storm, then awakens in a manner similar to the movie, where he meets his great-great-grandson, rather than an aged Murph. After being bored with the new world, Cooper steals a ship to find Brand (the two had been intimate before Brand left Cooper, to continue to explore space, rather than return to Earth).

I got this from the IMDB trivia page for the movie: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/trivia   Before Christopher Nolan joined the project, Steven Spielberg was attached to direct the movie 'Interstellar' and the script for his version was vastly different from the script for the final film.",t5_2qh3s,movies & tv series,"1. Steven Spielberg left because he shifted his production company DreamWorks from Paramount to Disney. Christopher Nolan was recommended to the studio by Jonathan Nolan, his brother, who was the writer for the film.


2. Here is a short summary of the script of the Spielberg version:

The original script of the Steven Spielberg version of this movie depicts an almost entirely different movie. Some examples include Murph being a boy, no humans are first sent into space (probes are) and a probe leads Cooper to the hidden N.A.S.A. base, which is on a remote island in California where Brand and Cooper deep-sea dive for parts. Also, the robots are much more human-like, featuring hands and shoulders. TARS is sucked into space early on when the ship gets stuck between two black holes (Gargantua and Pantagruel, named for two French mythical giants) immediately after entering the wormhole. Afterward, the crew, including an additional member named Roth, only visit the ice planet, where they discover that a Chinese mission had been there around thirty years prior, and seemed to have vanished, until it is learned that they were killed by the radiation of a neutron star. The crew falls through the ice into an entirely different ecosystem with a living rearranging forest and colonial organisms that fight each other every night, compounding into larger organisms to reach a higher spot closer to the ice ""sky"" for sunlight in the day. After searching the area, they find an abandoned Chinese camp with an experimental black box that can control gravity, and are then discovered by Chinese robots who sabotage their return home with the box. The crew orbits a black hole for hundreds of Earth years before entering a second wormhole where they interact directly with the fifth dimension bulk beings who lead them to a four thousand-year-old space station built by the Chinese that's only a few hundred years old, due to space-time relativity, powered by a captured mini black hole that views galaxies as flat lines of light. The Chinese have built thousands of worm holes, and tried to travel back in time with the gravity technology to save all of Earth, but died in the process. Cooper returns to Earth, in the year 2230, to find a barren land with ice storms. He sits down prepared to die in the storm, then awakens in a manner similar to the movie, where he meets his great-great-grandson, rather than an aged Murph. After being bored with the new world, Cooper steals a ship to find Brand (the two had been intimate before Brand left Cooper, to continue to explore space, rather than return to Earth).

2584,"So I recently went to see Rocketman (far more enjoyable than I thought it'd be by the way) and early on in the movie there's a scene where our hero, Young Elton John, sits at the piano while the radio plays. He starts intuitively playing the notes along with the music and his mother and grandmother drop everything they're doing to observe him in awestruck wonder as he plonks out the melody. ""See?! He's a genius!"", the movie seems to scream at the audience.

Then later on a now Adult Elton plays a impromptu piece on the piano for a record exec that turns out to Candle in the Wind. ""Did you just come up with that there?"" He asks in Awestruck Wonder^tm. ""Uhh yeah"" Elton answers oblivious to the monumental genius he just displayed.

I've noticed this particular moment in movies that I've come to see as the ""Good Will Hunting"" moment as in, you know, that scene where our Undiscovered Genius does something so exceptional and wondrous that the unexceptional plebs in the room gaze on in amazement and deference.


Another recent example is the movie Tolkien, a pretty run of the mill biopic that hilariously casts someone that looks so unlike the man himself that one wonders if they ever actually looked at pictures of him.

Of course something like this probably never happened and Tolkien was very reluctant about sharing his work 

So after this amazing story is finished, his lady love gazes on silently in her best Awestruck Wonder^tm and the movie desperately screams at us: ""See?! He's a genius!""

Never mind the years of learning and honing the craft these people had to endure to be able to do what they do, these types of scenes seem to imply you're either are a Undiscovered Genius or you're a side character pleb and there's no in between.

2596,"Over the last week I read Ian Flemings first James Bond novel Casino Royale for the first time and later re watched the movie. Here are some thoughts on both, including a comparison of similarities, differences and the over all enjoyment I get out of both of these pieces.

**Technical aspects:**

[Casino Royale](https://www.amazon.de/Casino-Royale-James-Bond-Band/dp/0099575973/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=casino+royale+book&amp;qid=1559589736&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1) (novel, 1953), written by Ian Fleming \[27 short chapters, around 250 pages, depending on edition\]

[Casino Royale](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/) (movie, 2006), directed by Martin Campbell \[144 minute runtime\]

Before diving into further comparisons, there are **two** obvious, but also **significant differences** between the movie and the novel. The first being the **time it is set in**, both are contemporary to their release date. Meaning the novel is set in the Cold War whereas the movie is set in the 21 century. Because of the resulting differences in international relations historically speaking, you could transfer it (but you don't have to) to the second difference. Flemings novel is a **political espionage thriller**, whereas Campbells movie re-boot is basically an **action movie**.

\----------

**Structure:**

The over all **plot of the movie is very similar**, nearly identical to its source material.

James Bond, a fresh 00, is set in a high stakes Poker game against Le Chiffre, a desperate (&amp; near bankrupt) banker working for terrorist organizations. Bonds allies are Mathis, Felix Leiter &amp; Vesper Lynd. Bond wins the money, Vesper &amp; him get captured, following the torture, Le Chiffre being interrupted/killed by a member of a mysterious organization. After Bond &amp; Vesper seek a happy life, the latter is confronted with her ""real"" identity/past &amp; kills herself, leaving Bond emotionally broken &amp; eventually cold.

As said in my first paragraph, Flemings novel isn't an ""action"" novel. There is an early assassination/botched bomb attempt in the early chapters (similar to the airport sequence) but it's nowhere near as action heavy as the movie, which follows *parkour chases*, *knife fights &amp; bus/plane explosions, stairway fights &amp; the closing crumbling house set piece.*

Narratively Bond **meets his allies way earlier,** in the movie Vesper &amp; Mathis are introduced around an hour in, whereas in the novel already in the first few chapters, Felix Leiter is introduced very late in the movie and only after Bond is struggling in the Poker game. The whole Dimitrious, Ellipse stuff isn't in the novel.

\----------

**Main characters:**

**- James Bond:**

Bonds portrayal is very close to the novel. He's described as a very tough man, perfectly shown by Craigs physical appearance, his hard &amp; masculine face &amp; the early corporal fight scenes &amp; chases. His attitude fits the source material. Bond is smart &amp; charming, but he can switch of in any moment to being a ruthless killer.

**- Vesper Lynd:**

A big part of Vespers character in the novel is her beauty. There are long passages describing everything about her body &amp; face. She certainly is beautiful in the movie, played by the gorgeous Eva Green. Yet in the movie she comes across as much more independent &amp; aware. She's smart in the novel, but much more worthy in a psychological duel with Bond in the movie. In both the movie &amp; novel she is a double agent, who got blackmailed &amp; had to take this identity in order to save her boyfriend, but then fell in love with James.

**- Le Chiffre:**

Le Chiffre, in both movie &amp; novel is a scary fucking dude. There still is something a bit charming about Mikkelsen presence though. He's described as considerably ugly in the novel, and basically as the epitome of evil. In the movie he comes across as more ""human"", desperation etc (make no mistake he's a vicious bastard, but he's not the devil).

**- M:**

The obvious difference is the gender swap in M. In the novel, Bond respects &amp; in some way even fears M. The Bond/M relationship of Flemings books never really translated onto the bigger screen (it's tough to find someone intimidating against the charisma of Connery to be fair) so the change is an interesting touch. While he certainly respects Judi Denchs M, there is more slick and clever dialogue coming out of the conversations.

\----------

**The Poker Game:**

The Poker game in the novel, as basically all of it, is set in **France**, whereas the movie jumps around Madagascar, the Bahamas, Venice &amp; **Montenegro**, the latter being the setting of the poker game.

Also, in the novel they play Baccarat, which was very popular at that time, in the movie they play Texas Hold 'Em, which (surprise) was popular in that time. The game itself is similar structured, back and forth until Le Chiffre wins a big one and Bond is in huge desperation but comes back in the last round winning all of it (with the help of Felix Leiters money).

In both movie &amp; novel, Le Chiffre tries to prevent/""attack"" Bond during the last hand. In the movie he gets poisoned, which nearly causes him to pass out. In the novel, he is directly physically threatened by a bodyguard of the Le Chiffre with a gun under the table/chair.

\--------

**Remarkable similarities:**

\- Practically the entire torture scene is directly taken out of the source material. Bond gets stripped naked and tied up to a chair, then punched to the balls multiple times until the near pass out. Only difference is that in the movie Le Chiffre uses a rope, in the novel it is a carpet beater.

\- Some dialogue &amp; lines are extracted out of Flemings novel. Such as the Vesper/Martini order.

&gt;*Three measures of Gordons, one of* *vodka, half a measure of* *Kina Lillet.* *Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?*

Or the iconic line.

&gt;The bitch is dead.

\---------

**Other differences:**

\- The whole Mathis alleged double cross plot point only appears in the movie.

\- Vespers double cross, signaled by her seeing the man with the eye patch is left to a good bye letter in the novel that Bond reads after she'd poisoned herself. In the movie, she gives the man with the eye patch the money briefcase and after the shoot out in Venice, she traps herself in the elevator and drowns in the crumbling house.

\- In the books, the mysterious organization is SMERSH, a russian anti spy organization. In CR it is still unnamed, though in the later Craig films revealed to be SPECTRE.

\- The book ends very depressing as her betrayal letter is the last thing. The movie ends on a higher note with Bond capturing Mr White &amp; ending the movie in his iconic introduction lines.

\---------

I have certainly missed a ton of differences of both, but I feel like I have done enough to highlight most of them. Here are some of my personal **thoughts:**

**The novel:**

I had a ton of fun reading it for the first time. It's certainly colder &amp; much more serious than a lot of James Bond movies but I liked that it felt more grounded and had espionage instead of thrills. There is a lot of political subtext added by Ian Fleming that reflects on the cold war and on spy agents themselves. It also features some great insight on the Poker game as Bonds mind is on full display with mathematical &amp; stochastically relevant information throughout every hand. I think it ends on a very depressing and sad note, setting the tone for the character to come.

**The movie:**

I have always considered Casino Royale to be **one of my favorite movies of all time.** I think it's head and shoulders above every other James Bond film and every time I watch it I discover new things I love about it. The way the movie starts, with the cold blooded double-O earning in a noir fashion, then goes over to the gorgeous credit sequence with so much ingenuity sprinkled across it, is amazing. I'm also amazed by the **action** the movie has. The Parkour chase has some terrific stunt work &amp; innovation. Or the airplane sequence is packed with enormous tension and suspense. Or the closing Venice shoot out is packed with bad ass moments by Bond. A lot of my love for the movie also comes from the **cast.** It does contain my a.) favorite Felix Leiter (played by Jeffrey Wright), b.) favorite Bond girl (Vesper Lynd by Eva Green), c.) the best M (played by Judi Dench) and one of my favorite Bond villains (played by Mads Mikkelsen, who is as terrific as ever). **Martin Campbell** has rock solid directing, focussing on the great stuff of the source material and just like in *GoldenEye* knowing how to introduce a new Bond &amp; a new way of Bond into the franchise. **Daniel Craig** is relentlessly amazing. He has the charms, he definitely has the looks, he is believable in the kills, he has a soul, he has a heart, he has emotion. Only Connery is better. The movie also looks gorgeous. Not only its vast settings of exotic locations, beautiful women, high class restaurants, cafes or hotels, pieces of clothing and so on, but also its sharp image and cinematography, by Phil Meheux is astounding. Despite being literally written by three people it also contains some ingenious dialogue. Especially the Bond/Vesper interactions flow so crisply and soft. It's a joy to watch every second of it and I could be talking about it for hours.

All in all, Casino Royale is a great novel and in my opinion, an even greater movie which is a faithful adaptation but also adds many layers and new things to it, knowing that it already is part of a 20+ movie series and therefore adding nostalgia, references or treating its timeless main characters legacy with honor and self reflection.

What do you think about Casino Royale, both the novel &amp; the movie?   Casino Royale (2006) is a thematically faithful adaptation of Flemings influential novel, a masterpiece and the greatest James Bond movie ever made. Here is a comparison I made between the movie/novel &amp; my thoughts on both of them.",t5_2qh3s,movies & tv series,"Over the last week I read Ian Flemings first James Bond novel Casino Royale for the first time and later re watched the movie. Here are some thoughts on both, including a comparison of similarities, differences and the over all enjoyment I get out of both of these pieces.

**Technical aspects:**

[Casino Royale](https://www.amazon.de/Casino-Royale-James-Bond-Band/dp/0099575973/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=casino+royale+book&amp;qid=1559589736&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1) (novel, 1953), written by Ian Fleming \[27 short chapters, around 250 pages, depending on edition\]

[Casino Royale](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/) (movie, 2006), directed by Martin Campbell \[144 minute runtime\]

Before diving into further comparisons, there are **two** obvious, but also **significant differences** between the movie and the novel. The first being the **time it is set in**, both are contemporary to their release date. Meaning the novel is set in the Cold War whereas the movie is set in the 21 century. Because of the resulting differences in international relations historically speaking, you could transfer it (but you don't have to) to the second difference. Flemings novel is a **political espionage thriller**, whereas Campbells movie re-boot is basically an **action movie**.

\----------

**Structure:**

The over all **plot of the movie is very similar**, nearly identical to its source material.

James Bond, a fresh 00, is set in a high stakes Poker game against Le Chiffre, a desperate (&amp; near bankrupt) banker working for terrorist organizations. Bonds allies are Mathis, Felix Leiter &amp; Vesper Lynd. Bond wins the money, Vesper &amp; him get captured, following the torture, Le Chiffre being interrupted/killed by a member of a mysterious organization. After Bond &amp; Vesper seek a happy life, the latter is confronted with her ""real"" identity/past &amp; kills herself, leaving Bond emotionally broken &amp; eventually cold.

As said in my first paragraph, Flemings novel isn't an ""action"" novel. There is an early assassination/botched bomb attempt in the early chapters (similar to the airport sequence) but it's nowhere near as action heavy as the movie, which follows *parkour chases*, *knife fights &amp; bus/plane explosions, stairway fights &amp; the closing crumbling house set piece.*

Narratively Bond **meets his allies way earlier,** in the movie Vesper &amp; Mathis are introduced around an hour in, whereas in the novel already in the first few chapters, Felix Leiter is introduced very late in the movie and only after Bond is struggling in the Poker game. The whole Dimitrious, Ellipse stuff isn't in the novel.

\----------

**Main characters:**

**- James Bond:**

Bonds portrayal is very close to the novel. He's described as a very tough man, perfectly shown by Craigs physical appearance, his hard &amp; masculine face &amp; the early corporal fight scenes &amp; chases. His attitude fits the source material. Bond is smart &amp; charming, but he can switch of in any moment to being a ruthless killer.

**- Vesper Lynd:**

A big part of Vespers character in the novel is her beauty. There are long passages describing everything about her body &amp; face. She certainly is beautiful in the movie, played by the gorgeous Eva Green. Yet in the movie she comes across as much more independent &amp; aware. She's smart in the novel, but much more worthy in a psychological duel with Bond in the movie. In both the movie &amp; novel she is a double agent, who got blackmailed &amp; had to take this identity in order to save her boyfriend, but then fell in love with James.

**- Le Chiffre:**

Le Chiffre, in both movie &amp; novel is a scary fucking dude. There still is something a bit charming about Mikkelsen presence though. He's described as considerably ugly in the novel, and basically as the epitome of evil. In the movie he comes across as more ""human"", desperation etc (make no mistake he's a vicious bastard, but he's not the devil).

**- M:**

The obvious difference is the gender swap in M. In the novel, Bond respects &amp; in some way even fears M. The Bond/M relationship of Flemings books never really translated onto the bigger screen (it's tough to find someone intimidating against the charisma of Connery to be fair) so the change is an interesting touch. While he certainly respects Judi Denchs M, there is more slick and clever dialogue coming out of the conversations.

\----------

**The Poker Game:**

The Poker game in the novel, as basically all of it, is set in **France**, whereas the movie jumps around Madagascar, the Bahamas, Venice &amp; **Montenegro**, the latter being the setting of the poker game.

Also, in the novel they play Baccarat, which was very popular at that time, in the movie they play Texas Hold 'Em, which (surprise) was popular in that time. The game itself is similar structured, back and forth until Le Chiffre wins a big one and Bond is in huge desperation but comes back in the last round winning all of it (with the help of Felix Leiters money).

In both movie &amp; novel, Le Chiffre tries to prevent/""attack"" Bond during the last hand. In the movie he gets poisoned, which nearly causes him to pass out. In the novel, he is directly physically threatened by a bodyguard of the Le Chiffre with a gun under the table/chair.

\--------

**Remarkable similarities:**

\- Practically the entire torture scene is directly taken out of the source material. Bond gets stripped naked and tied up to a chair, then punched to the balls multiple times until the near pass out. Only difference is that in the movie Le Chiffre uses a rope, in the novel it is a carpet beater.

\- Some dialogue &amp; lines are extracted out of Flemings novel. Such as the Vesper/Martini order.

&gt;*Three measures of Gordons, one of* *vodka, half a measure of* *Kina Lillet.* *Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?*

Or the iconic line.

&gt;The bitch is dead.

\---------

**Other differences:**

\- The whole Mathis alleged double cross plot point only appears in the movie.

\- Vespers double cross, signaled by her seeing the man with the eye patch is left to a good bye letter in the novel that Bond reads after she'd poisoned herself. In the movie, she gives the man with the eye patch the money briefcase and after the shoot out in Venice, she traps herself in the elevator and drowns in the crumbling house.

\- In the books, the mysterious organization is SMERSH, a russian anti spy organization. In CR it is still unnamed, though in the later Craig films revealed to be SPECTRE.

\- The book ends very depressing as her betrayal letter is the last thing. The movie ends on a higher note with Bond capturing Mr White &amp; ending the movie in his iconic introduction lines.

\---------

I have certainly missed a ton of differences of both, but I feel like I have done enough to highlight most of them. Here are some of my personal **thoughts:**

**The novel:**

I had a ton of fun reading it for the first time. It's certainly colder &amp; much more serious than a lot of James Bond movies but I liked that it felt more grounded and had espionage instead of thrills. There is a lot of political subtext added by Ian Fleming that reflects on the cold war and on spy agents themselves. It also features some great insight on the Poker game as Bonds mind is on full display with mathematical &amp; stochastically relevant information throughout every hand. I think it ends on a very depressing and sad note, setting the tone for the character to come.

**The movie:**

I have always considered Casino Royale to be **one of my favorite movies of all time.** I think it's head and shoulders above every other James Bond film and every time I watch it I discover new things I love about it. The way the movie starts, with the cold blooded double-O earning in a noir fashion, then goes over to the gorgeous credit sequence with so much ingenuity sprinkled across it, is amazing. I'm also amazed by the **action** the movie has. The Parkour chase has some terrific stunt work &amp; innovation. Or the airplane sequence is packed with enormous tension and suspense. Or the closing Venice shoot out is packed with bad ass moments by Bond. A lot of my love for the movie also comes from the **cast.** It does contain my a.) favorite Felix Leiter (played by Jeffrey Wright), b.) favorite Bond girl (Vesper Lynd by Eva Green), c.) the best M (played by Judi Dench) and one of my favorite Bond villains (played by Mads Mikkelsen, who is as terrific as ever). **Martin Campbell** has rock solid directing, focussing on the great stuff of the source material and just like in *GoldenEye* knowing how to introduce a new Bond &amp; a new way of Bond into the franchise. **Daniel Craig** is relentlessly amazing. He has the charms, he definitely has the looks, he is believable in the kills, he has a soul, he has a heart, he has emotion. Only Connery is better. The movie also looks gorgeous. Not only its vast settings of exotic locations, beautiful women, high class restaurants, cafes or hotels, pieces of clothing and so on, but also its sharp image and cinematography, by Phil Meheux is astounding. Despite being literally written by three people it also contains some ingenious dialogue. Especially the Bond/Vesper interactions flow so crisply and soft. It's a joy to watch every second of it and I could be talking about it for hours.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, Casino Royale is a great novel and in my opinion, an even greater movie which is a faithful adaptation but also adds many layers and new things to it, knowing that it already is part of a 20+ movie series and therefore adding nostalgia, references or treating its timeless main characters legacy with honor and self reflection.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Godzilla: King of the Monsters -** Poor pun based box office writers. You know they've had their ""Godzilla is King of the box office"" headlines ready for weeks but I'm not so sure that Godzilla: King of the Monsters opening at #1 with $49M is really worthy of royalty status. The sequel to the 2014 reboot of the American Godzilla franchise and third film in the 'Monsterverse' was not exactly a major franchise crowning itself god of all as the film opened $40M less than Godzilla '14 which opened to $92M. Overseas the numbers are a little healthier, topping off the worldwide gross with $179M, but the thing is kaiju movies have never been global blockbuster events. If we are counting King Kong (which is part of the Monsterverse, so I think so) then Kong: Skull Island is the biggest one ever at $566.6M, with almost $400M of that from overseas. And Godzilla '14 made just $325M overseas so Godzilla: KOTM needs to do way better domestically or else it will be a major blow to the franchise, especially with another film coming in less than a year (Godzilla vs King Kong). So why did this film do so much less than the previous film featuring the chonky scalie boy?
* **Godzilla: King of the Monsters (cont.) -** Well for outside factor we must note this weekend was the same as the NBA Finals on Sunday. I went to see Rocketman at the same time (are you shocked I'm not a sports guy?) and the theater was a ghost town. But that doesn't explain the low opening of $19.6M on the first day. The reviews certainly didn't help, with critics slamming the film for its over-reliance on monster fights over terrible human characters. And while kaiju fans are used to terrible characters that you tolerate to get to the big monster fights, maybe that's a tradition that doesn't *have* to exist, especially when trying to appeal to a wider audience. Also even kaiju fans seems mixed on the film, more positive than Godzilla '14 but still some strong negative vibes. I think WOM on this one could be terrible, and I wouldn't be shocked at a strong drop-off next weekend. There's also just the subject matter itself. The 2014 film was based on the most recognizable Godzilla film, the 1958 original Gojira. But the closest analog to Godzilla: KOTM is 1964's Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster which is about a princess being taken over by an alien ghost and who warns of a space dragon that will destroy the world (for real). Basically what I'm saying is, this one is for kaiju nerds, not the regular audience. And the audience likely got their fill of the big boy in 2014 which was criticized for not enough Godzilla action and people don't want to get duped again. Whatever the cause Godzilla vs King Kong will need a major glow-up for this franchise to continue, lest Toho once again takes the rights and scampers off into the night.
* **Godzilla: King of the Monsters (cont.) -** Also make a $150M solo Mothra movie, you absolute fucking cowards.
* **Rocketman** \- Despite me buying 12 tickets to just see the Taron Egerton/Richard Madden sex scene over and over the biopic about Elton John's life Rocketman did not hit #1 but did manage to score a very good debut at #3 with $25M. So of course the comparison here is to Bohemian Rhapsody, the other film about a massive 70s queer musician which definitely has and will trounce Rocketman in all box office comparisons, opening twice what Rocketman just did and going on to gross an insane $900M worldwide. But I don't think that was ever in the cards for Rocketman, which let's be frank took a lot more risks than BR. For one the film is R-rated, becoming the first American studio film to show a male on male love scene (before your comments, Brokeback Mountain was made and distributed by an independent studio). It already has faced major edits from homophobic countries like Russia and will struggle for that reason. Also the film is not your standard biopic, as it is a straight up jukebox musical retelling of Elton John's life, with various people singing his songs and large dance sequences. And while Elton John was the biggest selling artist of his day, I'm not sure younger people adore him so much they will rush out to see his biopic ASAP.
* **Rocketman (cont.)** \- So the lower opening is expected and it is the 4th biggest musical biopic opening, so it's done well in terms of overall comparisons. The real test will be how the film holds and that's harder to know. It scored a very good A- on Cinemascore, by so did All Eyez on Me, the Tupac biopic that opened the same as Rocketman but dropped like a rock when fan backlash killed its momentum. So far it seems Elton fans are very happy with the film and with it being an older generation play (55% of the opening weekend audience was over 30) you tend to see long consistent holds versus massive openings. But the pure musical style could turn off some people who don't want something so different, and may just want to see the standard Walk Hard but serious movie they've done 100,000 times now. Look you may find that style tiring but just last year it made $900M and won 4 Oscars so don't expect it to go away any time soon. Speaking of it definitely feels like Rocketman has set itself up as an early Oscar frontrunner, with Taron Egerton and the costume design feeling like locks already, though of course much of that will change in the coming months and will depend heavily on the film's performance and how many people like me ship Madderton.
* **Ma** \- MA! Get in here, Ma just opened up at #4 with $18.2M, Ma! MAAAAA! Okay I'm done, but for real the horror film that dared to ask what if Octavia Spencer was spooky had a pretty good opening this week, especially in comparison to its $5M budget. The film focused  a lot of its branding on the fact that beloved character actress Octavia Spencer was playing bad and not playing nice to some white person in trouble (ooooh the comments, they're coming in hot). The film scored decent-ish reviews, mostly for Spencer's performance but seemed less enthused by audiences with a B- on Cinemascore. I expect a fairly hefty drop next weekend but that's the thing with horror, you cost $5M to make and it doesn't really matter how bad your next weekend is cause you already got that money baby. Hopefully this will inspire a new wave of actors who usually play nice people turning evil. Tom Hanks serial killer movie when?

And while Elton John was the biggest selling artist of his day, I'm not sure younger people adore him so much they will rush out to see his biopic ASAP.
* **Rocketman (cont.)** \- So the lower opening is expected and it is the 4th biggest musical biopic opening, so it's done well in terms of overall comparisons. The real test will be how the film holds and that's harder to know. It scored a very good A- on Cinemascore, by so did All Eyez on Me, the Tupac biopic that opened the same as Rocketman but dropped like a rock when fan backlash killed its momentum. So far it seems Elton fans are very happy with the film and with it being an older generation play (55% of the opening weekend audience was over 30) you tend to see long consistent holds versus massive openings. But the pure musical style could turn off some people who don't want something so different, and may just want to see the standard Walk Hard but serious movie they've done 100,000 times now. Look you may find that style tiring but just last year it made $900M and won 4 Oscars so don't expect it to go away any time soon. Speaking of it definitely feels like Rocketman has set itself up as an early Oscar frontrunner, with Taron Egerton and the costume design feeling like locks already, though of course much of that will change in the coming months and will depend heavily on the film's performance and how many people like me ship Madderton.
* **Ma** \- MA! Get in here, Ma just opened up at #4 with $18.2M, Ma! MAAAAA! Okay I'm done, but for real the horror film that dared to ask what if Octavia Spencer was spooky had a pretty good opening this week, especially in comparison to its $5M budget. The film focused  a lot of its branding on the fact that beloved character actress Octavia Spencer was playing bad and not playing nice to some white person in trouble (ooooh the comments, they're coming in hot). The film scored decent-ish reviews, mostly for Spencer's performance but seemed less enthused by audiences with a B- on Cinemascore. I expect a fairly hefty drop next weekend but that's the thing with horror, you cost $5M to make and it doesn't really matter how bad your next weekend is cause you already got that money baby. Hopefully this will inspire a new wave of actors who usually play nice people turning evil. Tom Hanks serial killer movie when?

2640,"I often read the comments from trailers of films I'm excited to watch and one being ""Terminator: Dark Fate"". Yes, the trailer was underwhelming. Nevertheless, the trailer doesn't indicate if the film is good or bad or else Suicide Squad and Godzilla: King of the Monsters would have turned out to be stellar films. 

SOME critics appear to take issue with the fact Dark Fate has women taking center stage, from Mackenzie Davis' Terminator to Natalie Reyes' Dani Ramos to the return of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. Accusations of it being woke, of it being feminist propaganda and I'm confused because what do these critics conceive as feminist propaganda? 

So Aliens was feminist because Ripley was the lead? Kill Bill: Vol.1 was feminist because the lead is the Bride? 

I find it curious how the same critics who accuse the Left of being snowflakes are the first to complain when a action film comes out and has a woman as the hero. 

If it was a film about a woman who was killing men and it generalized men as rapists and abusers or indicated women were superior to women, you could say it was extreme feminism. Yet, none of what we've seen in the trailer for Dark Fate, indicate these fears aside from the fact it has three leading women and we still don't know how central a part will Arnold Schwarzenegger have. 

Even the complain about Rey in the Star Wars film. I don't like Rey, not because she's a woman and anyone who accuses the film of being feminist is misguided, but because she's poorly written. You don't benefit a character by never having her struggle or allow proper development. We've never had that with her. 

I don't like when gender becomes a central focus on a lead, be it male or female. I just find it condescending when you have a character victimize oneself over and over again. It's not heroic.

2671,"I know lots of people on the internet are young and don't really get this, but just because Rotten Tomatoes gives a seal of disapproval to a movie you liked, doesn't mean they're WRONG or PAID OFF, nor does it mean that critics think YOU are wrong for liking it.

You can call them biased all you want but everyone has biases including you and I. I loved Godzilla and as a kaiju fan I am biased, and that may or may not have had an effect on how much I enjoyed it. Point is, you can't force anyone else to like a movie as much as you do, so don't even try.

If you loved Godzilla King of the Monsters, don't make it your life's purpose to convince people they're wrong for liking it. Instead, praise Godzilla for the reasons YOU loved it. If Godzilla: King of the Monsters is really that good, than the only thing that could possibly convince people of that is POSITIVITY. 

And let me just say this: I know you may think it's unfair for such an awesome movie to get bad reviews because that will definitely entice less people to go and see it. However, nobody sees a bunch of screaming fanboys calling critics childish names, and thinks ""You know what, the critics must be wrong. Godzilla 2 must be great!"" They just see a bunch of screaming idiots and that only re-enforces the reviews suggesting that the movie is that bad. If you put your energy into love for the movie, it will entice more people to see it.

**TL;DR: Attacking critics will get you nowhere. If you want to express your admiration for a movie, there's no need for hostility against people who don't. Toxic fanbases destroy franchises. **   With Godzilla King of the Monsters opening this weekend, I think this is a good time to remind everyone who may have forgotten that it's OK to disagree with critics and there's no need to attack them.",t5_2qh3s,movies & tv series,"I know lots of people on the internet are young and don't really get this, but just because Rotten Tomatoes gives a seal of disapproval to a movie you liked, doesn't mean they're WRONG or PAID OFF, nor does it mean that critics think YOU are wrong for liking it.

[Parasite ](https://i.redd.it/dt47oe9soe131.jpg)

There are moments in [Parasite](https://thefilmera.com/2019/05/27/parasite-review-bong-joon-hos-latest-feature-is-untouchable/) that had my jaw on the floor, and I say that with the utmost certainty and honesty. There are sequences here that are so bold, and so outstanding you feel privileged to watch this film, which is wholly farcical in nature — develop and unfold. One of the staple elements of Bong’s filmography ranging from *Mother*, *Okja* and *Memories of a Murder*, is how exquisite his respective film palettes are conceived and executed in terms of tone and genre. Bong is nothing short of a master when it comes to juggling the elements of *Parasite*. One sequence can have you crying with laughter, cold in fear, and breathless with the tension. There are multiple instances of this leading to you not thinking of anything else but what’s in front of your eyes. You’re totally in the grasp of the event in front of your eyes, causing some incredibly abstract moments from Bong — who knows full well you’re not going to escape to anywhere else. 

 On a technical standpoint in regards to the filmmaking, Parasite is untouchable. The craftsmanship ranging from the outstanding cinematography by Hong Kyung-Pyo to the swift and slick edit by Yang Jin-mo offers an experience that is at the very top of a standard we often see missing in current films. From the writing to the performances, we’re given an experience here from Bong Joon-Ho that is nothing short of top tier skill and craft that serves every cinematic purpose possible and then some. *Parasite* is an electrifying and monumental picture that demands repeat viewings, of which I am eager to oblige.

2714,"I recently watched this on a whim via the Criterion Channel, namely due to a kinda quirky description and a desire to watch a comedy I hadnt seen before. It is still available on the Criterion Channel, which I highly recommend subscribing to.

&amp;#x200B;

The  film details the day-to-day life of two women trying to make it in 1970s New York, both aspiring artists of some kind, and explores the complexity of female friendships as one of the two gets married and moves out to the country.

&amp;#x200B;

The story and themes, while now done a thousand times, were very new  to audiences in the 1970s, which did not have a lot of films that were realistic and introspectively looked at women and their lives during the second wave of feminism. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 1980, Stanley Kubrick had this to say about the film:

 

&gt;""I think one of the most interesting Hollywood films, well not Hollywood -- American films -- that I've seen in a long time is Claudia Weill's *Girlfriends*. That film, I thought, was one of the very rare American films that I would compare with the serious, intelligent, sensitive writing and filmmaking that you find in the best directors in Europe. It wasn't a success, I don't know why; it should have been. Certainly I thought it was a wonderful film. It seemed to make no compromise to the inner truth of the story, you know, the theme and everything else...  
&gt;  
&gt;The great problem is that the films cost so much now; in America it's almost impossible to make a good film -- which means you have to spend a certain amount of time on it, and have good technicians and good actors -- that aren't very, very expensive. This film that Claudia Weill did, I think she did on an amateur basis; she shot it for about a year, two or three days a week. Of course she had a great advantage, because she had all the time she needed to think about it, to see what she had done. I thought she made the film extremely well.""

&amp;#x200B;

The film  was, more recently, cited as a major inspiration for HBO's Girls, which it is tonally similar to, in a far more toned down/realistic way.

2731,"I recently watched Seven Samurai after putting it off for a while, and what I saw I enjoyed a lot. This is my second Akira Kurosawa film and he is already one of my favourite directors. Toshiro Mifune really knocks it out the park with his performace, I was delightfully surprised that his character was more than a buffoon, adding complexity and even questioning the morality of our protagonists. Kurosawa to me, seems to yet again inject a good sense of humour into this film using the characters for comedy rather than random quips. The cinematography and blocking in this film is beautiful, putting a lot of today's films to shame.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly i'm a bit tired of some films, especially hollywood films where the heroes always come out on top, sqeaky clean and morally righteous. Here we have a film that questions the morality of it's protagonists. Even the final fight takes place on a muddy battlefield as people struggle from slipping over in the mud, with some of the heroes unceremoniously killed. The ending leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth as you wonder what the hell it was all for. In a typical film it would have been all cheery cheery, pats on the back, but I like that the film leaves you in a sombre mood, and for me it's a breath of fresh air in today's paint by numbers films that seem to litter the landscape. If you haven't seen Seven Samurai then I highly recommend you do so if you love films, and if you have then what are your thoughts on Seven Samurai?

2804,"So I made a post a few weeks ago asking for recommendations (https://www.reddit.com/r/BollywoodRealism/comments/996idm/best_bollywood_realism_movies/) and I wound up watching Bahubali 1 and 2 and I have to say, I'm completely blown away.

I was told that it wasn't just hilarious and over the top, and that the story was great as well, but I never expected to be so good! I watched the two parts on different nights, but neither part felt like a particularly long movie, even though each one nears 3 hours. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Seriously, this is one of my new favorite movies.

My biggest fear now is that nothing else in this genre can compare. I have a lot of other suggestions on my list (Endhiran, Singham, Jaani Dushman, etc), but I guess time will tell if they will hold up to this standard. I'll probably be watching one tonight!

I came across a short fightscene long time ago, and could not find it since then.

The fightscene started in front of old parking lot or unfinished building (probably the building). Group of people went inside the building where boss with subordinates has been awaiting their arrival. Head of the coming group had long black cape and sunglasses and of course had a moustache. When they trashtalk each other, one used occasionally english words (hand-to-hand and something else). Caped guy snapped fingers and his subordinates formed a throne with their bodies for him to sit on. It is tough to find, because in this scene there was no ""famous"" actor like Prabhas or guy playing Singham..etc. Thank you for any hint.

Firstly the story was written in 1892 and Gilman was a precedent to the later
suffragettes rebelling against the patriarchal society and advocating for women to
gain socioeconomic independence from their husbands. 

It is heavily emphasised that
this story is, in fact, autobiographical; Gilman suffered postpartum depression
during her marriage to her first husband. She was treated by a physician dubbed Dr
S.W Mitchell who prescribed the ""resting cure"" which in modern times would be seen
as enabling depressive tendencies.

 It is believed the book is a protest to the medical
profession and the stigma of mental illness in the 19th century whilst additionally
being a veiled metaphor for the subordination of women in society and the
importance of self-expression.


The story is in the epistolary form similar to works such as The Perks of Being a
Wallflower. It consists of the narrator's secret journal entries. Said text can easily fit
into the theme of Gothic horror due to the supernatural sequel events. It must be
noted from the beginning that the narrator has no name illustrating that she as a
woman is anonymous in society this could further be linked with Mrs De Winter in
the novel Rebecca by Daphne du mariner who is known only by her married name
illustrating her as nothing more than her husband's property and successor of his
first wife Rebecca.



The narrator and her husband John spend the summer at a gorgeous colonial
mansion isolated from society. From the get-go, we as readers can spot unhealthy
elements of John and the narrator's relationship. He laughs at her and her opinions
and belittles her opinions. John is scientific yet unenlightened. Completely in
contrast to his inquisitive and creative wife, he boils his wife's illness down to
""temporary nervous depression -a slight hysterical tendency"" She is forbidden to
work and only to rest. It is without a doubt his wife's views juxtapose his, she believes
""congenial work with excitement and change would do her good"" with modern
research into depression she is right.
She is posted in the top room of the house in the attic. A large airy room with giant
windows, rings and things on the wall, a heavy bed nailed to the floor and revolting
yellow wallpaper. 

The narrator elaborately describes the wallpaper in great lengths.
In the beginning, she hates it ""the colour is repellent almost revolting; a smouldering
unclean yellow strangely faded by the slow turning sun"" the speaker is adamant that
the room was converted from a nursery but indeed my interpretation is that the
house was once a home to mentally ill patients. What nursery would have a bed
nailed to the floor and rings in the walls?
With what little stimulation the voice has becomes invested in figuring out the shapes
on the wallpaper and eventually becomes insomniac and stays awake at night in
attempts to solve the puzzle that is the wallpaper.



This consistent activity is the very thing that sees the end of her sanity. She fancies
that she sees a woman trapped by bars within the wallpaper. 

The Yellow Wallpaper is a definitely a haunting  read if you are interested in feminism or mental illness in the 1800s.   Charlotte Perkins Gilman -The yellow Wallpaper. (The Mad Woman in the Attic)",t5_2qhps,entertainment,"

Personally I view it as somewhat satisfying; the party constantly makes references to “Doublespeak”, the act of one phrase or term meaning another (LOVE is HATE, WAR is PEACE, etc.), and as Winston is confirmed to the authoritarian order of the new world in the third act through means of a sort of ‘rebirthing’ if you will, even though he is entirely conformed to the state in his actions and means of speech, the final line about “loving Big Brother” acts as an expression of Winston’s undying spirit. He’s been brutally beaten into the role subject, and as he embraces the new world order he is able to retain his hate for Big Brother, just expressed in a new way. I think it’s a somewhat freeing and encouraging message of the undying human spirit, retaining internal conditions despite external changes.

So, I finally picked up *The House on Mango Street* by Sandra Cisneros, for the first time.

I will be teaching this book next semester, and so I figured I would write my thoughts on it since I am still trying to figure it out. I also had a couple coworkers not totally agreeing with me on some of my ideas, and would love to see what y'all think. 

At first, I wasn't very fond of it. I'm definitely more of a ""traditional story"" sort of person. I'm pretty sure my last literature class really made me sick of these ""types"" of books, a collection of short stories that don’t necessarily have any plot. But still *The House on Mango Street* simply “is.""

I really would argue that there is no plot, per say, but yet there is a story; a story of a girl becoming a woman and reaching for her dream. There is a beginning physically in the book, but story-wise there isn't really a true start. There is an end, but not exactly a middle. There wasn't really a point where I could say, ""here is the rising action"" or ""here is where this event leads up to the next event."" But...I wasn't really bothered by that by the time I was halfway through.

Each word seems purposeful, and you could probably read this over and over again and notice something different. It is dense with detail, yet light rather than heavy. It does not have plot, structure, and development to weigh it down. Some have told me that the book actually *is* heavy and dense, so maybe you disagree with me on this. 

The descriptions and details are all so unique in how they form their metaphors and similes, though. A whole chapter is dedicated to clouds and they’re described in a dozen different ways that I would have never thought of before, and yet I could still picture each one vividly in my mind, completely understanding. I feel as if I haven't come across this very often in literature. 

I suppose that you could argue that it is simply a bunch of short stories, but I see them as more like characterizations, like snapshots of people captured in a couple of pages. And some snapshots seem to span over longer periods of time than others, but still they seem to encapsulate the people in such an honest and authentic way. At first I thought that these characterizations really were random and not really adding to one another or building upon each other. However, I think that all these little snapshots actually came together like puzzles pieces to form one larger, cohesive picture of a culture and a place.

As my coworker put it. ""It's a story without the filler and without the fluff. It is only the most important parts.""

 The book was silly and serious all at once. I wasn’t exactly completely engaged in this book. It didn’t have me on the edge of my seat, excited to see what would happen next, but I realize that that doesn’t matter. It still made me smile, sometimes uneasily and sometimes like a child. At times, it still made my heart pang and the hairs on my skin stand on edge. 

When Sandra said that she wanted “a book that can be opened at any page and...still make sense to the reader who doesn’t know what came before or comes after,” I think she succeeded. The book is poetry and pictures, but the pictures are only words and the poetry is without structure. As I said, the book simply ""is"" and I cannot fault it in any way for that. It is beauty unique in its own way, honest and simple.

P.S. this is my first time posting here so let me know if I did something wrong :)   So, I Finally Read The House on Mango Street",t5_2qhps,entertainment," 

So, I finally picked up *The House on Mango Street* by Sandra Cisneros, for the first time.

I will be teaching this book next semester, and so I figured I would write my thoughts on it since I am still trying to figure it out. I also had a couple coworkers not totally agreeing with me on some of my ideas, and would love to see what y'all think. 

At first, I wasn't very fond of it. I'm definitely more of a ""traditional story"" sort of person. I'm pretty sure my last literature class really made me sick of these ""types"" of books, a collection of short stories that don’t necessarily have any plot. But still *The House on Mango Street* simply “is.""

I really would argue that there is no plot, per say, but yet there is a story; a story of a girl becoming a woman and reaching for her dream. There is a beginning physically in the book, but story-wise there isn't really a true start. There is an end, but not exactly a middle. There wasn't really a point where I could say, ""here is the rising action"" or ""here is where this event leads up to the next event."" But...I wasn't really bothered by that by the time I was halfway through.

Each word seems purposeful, and you could probably read this over and over again and notice something different. It is dense with detail, yet light rather than heavy. It does not have plot, structure, and development to weigh it down. Some have told me that the book actually *is* heavy and dense, so maybe you disagree with me on this. 

The descriptions and details are all so unique in how they form their metaphors and similes, though. A whole chapter is dedicated to clouds and they’re described in a dozen different ways that I would have never thought of before, and yet I could still picture each one vividly in my mind, completely understanding. I feel as if I haven't come across this very often in literature.

3079,"A part of me worries that, as time goes on, the novel is becoming little more than one of those titles on a student's summer reading list that's been put there for no reason other than that a teacher heard somewhere that it was ""a classic,"" and that it'd give off the appearance of an enriching curriculum for their supervisors. 

**Having recently finished it, I can attest that it deserves so much more than that.** 

*""Im Westen, nichts Neues""* as it was titled in its original German publication, roughly translates to ""There Is Nothing New to Report on the Western Front"" in Brian O. Murdoch's translation. To me, this title carries an entirely different meaning, and one that avid readers looking to pick up the novel should consider. While ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" carries something of a poetic implication, one of peace and resolution, its original title gives off an air of hopelessness. There's nothing new to report. Everything's going exactly the same way it always has. And in that regard, it is nothing short of a tragedy that we've normalized it.

Erich Remarque seems to have been born with Orwell's gift of using words conservatively while evoking nothing short of the most powerful message possible from them. This becomes apparent, starting with the opening epigraph: 

&gt;""This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.""

And just like that, in no more than two sentences (or one sentence, depending on the punctuation of the translator) the thesis statement of the novel is laid out for all to see. There will be no romantics to be found here. Bias will be avoided, and events will speak for themselves.

This passage is by no means an exception from the rest of the novel's style. 

&gt;""We have lost all feeling for one another. We can hardly control ourselves when our glance lights on the form of some other man. We are insensible, dead men, who through some trick, some dreadful magic, are still able to run and to kill.""

In many regards, this particular writing style seems to be unique to Remarque. Other war stories tend to linger on value claims, or attempts to persuade its reader one way or another. Remarque doesn't see the need to try. He simply writes as authentically as possible, and through that, lets the readers feel what he felt and see what he saw -- if not just a little bit.

And so comes my prompt, my question for everybody here at r/literature:

3088,"For such a short book (at barely 100 pages in my version), *Of Mice and Men* by John Steinbeck weighs in as an emotional heavyweight. Many readers attest to this story's ability to make them *feel*, or give them the *feels*.

So, how did that happen with such a slim novel?

Four things that truly make this little masterpiece the emotional gut-punch it is:

1. **Character motivations**. It's what Lennie, George, Candy, Crooks and all of the many other characters want. Particularly for George and Lennie, it's to live off the ""fadda the land"" and have rabbits and a stretch to grow hay; a little piece of their own, to call their own, and to live. Away from the pressures and neverending problems of other people and bosses and their misperceptions. Who wouldn't want that? Is it so wrong to want something so innocent?
2. **Scene setting**. The first page says it all. Steinbeck begins by explaining a spot by a river, where a heron and a hare and a squirrel are doing their thing, the light of a setting sun on the hills above, the flow of the water. Steinbeck ""sets the scene"" at multiple points through the book, often allowing the characters to walk away, and even all people leave, and he just lets the scene — that sense of place — speak for itself.
3. **A malleable moral core**. No spoiler here, but the crux of George and Lennie's relationship steers them toward what-feels-like an inevitable outcome. We should've seen it coming! But, even when it happens, at the end of the book, we're still sucker-punched with the moral weight of Steinbeck's character's tough and awful and unavoidable decisions. (Also see Cain and Abel tie-in here.)
4. **Reflection**. I don't know what else to call it, but it's when one act in one part of the story is reflected, metaphorically, in another part of the story. So when Steinbeck shows us Candy's old, old dog that ought to be just put out of its misery, he's putting that into the story *for a reason*. When Steinbeck introduces us to the spot by the river in the beginning, he does so *for a reason*. The entire story, despite its shortness, is filled with such reflectivity, which means it's filled with well-thoughout purpose and symmetry.

That's what I take away from *Of Mice and Men*, how it's able to hit the heart even after going on nearly a century since its publication. It's a book about innocence, loneliness, loss, and a sense of being misunderstood by everyone else. All any of us wants is a little spot of our own — but do we deserve it?

I have only ever done it silently and through sheer will power I have taught myself to be a pretty decent reader...in my head. When I started to read aloud a book called inkheart I started to choke back tears because the words became foreign to me again. I can’t speak and read at the same time.

So, I read [this version](https://www.abebooks.com/9780865162525/Epic-Gilgamesh-Danny-P-Jackson-0865162522/plp) of *The Epic of Gilgamesh* and what I take away from it is this: 

The core of the Gilgamesh myth is how Gilgamesh changes as a character. His **character arc**, in other words. Many, many writer’s self-help and “how to write a novel” websites expound the importance of your character *changing* over the course of the story. Your character begins incomplete in some way, unfinished. Yet they end better off—or worst off—whichever, so long as they *change*. 

I’m very enheartened to extract this important lesson on character arc out of the Gilgamesh myth…

But—those of you familiar with the myth may ask: Wait a second…What is Gilgamesh in the beginning? *A king*. And what is Gilgamesh in the end? *Still a king*. So—what really changes? 

…

Gilgamesh goes from being a bad king to a good king. *Cha-ching!* 

What precipitates this elemental change in Gilgamesh's character? 

1. Enkidu – The people of Uruk, soooo upset that Gilgamesh, their king, is so arrogant and authoritarian (he’s a *bad* king), that they pray to the Gods to relieve them of their suffering. Enter Enkidu. He comes to Uruk out of the wild and befriends Gilgamesh and wrestles with him and becomes Gilgamesh’s best friend (and lover) and joins him on adventures—such as slaying the forest monster, Humbaba. *But then!* Enkidu dies…Gilgamesh is completely overwrought by the death of his friend and forever changed by it… 

2. Utnapishtim — This fellow embodies the fallen angel archetype. He’s a Noah-figure (the only human being who survived the Great Flood and so he’s damned/promoted into a semi-divine status as Caretaker of the Underworld, where he rules without dying). Utnapishtim is sought out by Gilgamesh because Gilgamesh now wants to learn the secret to immortality, but he finds only an old, old man—who tells Gilgamesh about a secret that only the Gods know…

3. That damned snake — Gilgamesh discovers and grasps this plant (a thistle?) which will make him immortal and grant him everlasting glory. But as soon as he finds the plant, it’s taken—*by a snake!* A kind of random(?) snake just cruising around the Waters of Death, but then the plant is gone forever. Gilgamesh is, of course, totally distraught by all this—he’s journeyed so far, so long, through the very Waters of Death! and his great prize is stolen by a *snake!?* However, it’s that damned snake which allows Gilgamesh to finally “see the light,” so to speak…

Gilgamesh returns to Uruk—empty-handed. The secret to immortality has literally slipped through his fingers. Yet he looks upon the walls of Uruk…and proclaims his glory, his *immortality*, actually lies within those walls. In the great city he’s built as king:

&gt;Rise up now, Urshanabi \[the boatman\], and examine  
&gt;  
&gt;Uruk’s wall. Study the base, the brick,   
&gt;  
&gt;the old design. Is it permanent as can be?   
&gt;  
&gt;Does it look like wisdom designed it? 

Thus Gilgamesh finds his triumph in what he’s built. Indeed, one of the takeaways is that mortal man must find his immortality in what he builds; in what he/she leaves behind. 

Maybe true, maybe not…

But overall, I’m enheartened by the evidence that even this story—the oldest epic in (literally) history—encompasses this basic **character arc**. Particularly in that Gilgamesh changes from an arrogant, negative version of himself into a deeper, more positive one. (Happy endings receive more likes, lol…)

3125,"I've always been a fan of Raymond Chandler and his noir mysteries featuring the famous Phillip Marlowe as protagonist. In my opinion he was one of the great prose writers in American fiction of the twentieth century, elevating the entertaining and page-turning pulp style into an art form with memorable characters and prescient societal observations and critiques. Reading 'The Little Sister' for the first time, I came across this quote I thought I'd share.

To set the scene, Marlowe has just been grilled by a few cops - one of them playing the tough guy, the other two cynical, jaded, and sarcastic.- about some murders that might be tied into reefer peddling or blackmail. A stenographer, ""the orange queen,"" is also present.

""They just sat there and looked back at me. The orange queen was clacking her typewriter. Cop talk was no more treat to her than legs to a dance director. They had the calm weathered faces of healthy men in hard condition. They had the eyes they always have, cloudy and gray like freezing water. The firm set mouth, the hard wrinkles at the corners of the eyes, the hard hollow meaningless stare, not quite cruel and a thousand miles from kind. The dull ready-made clothes, worn without style, with a sort of contempt; the look of men who are poor abd yet proud of their power, watching always for ways to make it felt, to shove it into you and twist it and grin and watch you squirm, ruthless without malice, cruel and not yet always unkind. What would you expect them to be? Civilization had no meaning for them. All they saw of it was the failures, the dirt, the dregs, the aberrations and the disgust.""

There's so much to unpack here. Chandler turns an oft-used plot device - the private eye being grilled by the authorities, the former treading a fine line between the truth and covering his own ass - into an opportunity for finely crafted imagery, simile, and dagger-sharp social critique.

Chandler is not underestimated. Out of all the original noir practitioners, he is probably still the most well-read and highly regarded. But to me, his works are more than the emblematic examples of a classic American genre of fiction. Chandler showed that literature could both, in the Tolstoyan ethic, elevate the heart the soul and also, in the Nabokovian sense, exist chiefly for entertainment.

I dunno, maybe this is all gibberish, but I just felt inspired to share this. His works are really fantastic, and if you haven't read anything by him, I would absolutely give his books a shot. 'The Big Sleep' is a good start; it's an absolute classic that was made into a film with Humphrey Bogart.

So here it is then.

I am rereading Catch-22 as a sort of diversionary measure while cracking down on some work (mostly on the toilet). It’s one of the books that was most formative on my worldview as a younger person and I still find it extremely funny and insightful — albeit a little too on the nose for comfort occasionally. I’ve been studying Heller’s prose style as well, and I’m quite fond of the way he writes. Picked up some good tricks I’m going to try next time I sit down.  

Also on the list is some McCarthy, namely *The Road* and *Blood Meridian*. The Road I’ve read before. One very impactful book, though for different reasons that *Catch-22*. McCarthy is one of the people I cite as a major influence on my own prosaic style and it’s interesting coming back to the book as a more educated and perceptive (hopefully) reader. It’s also the source material for my first tattoo, so I feel very personally attached to it.  

*Blood meridian* is new to me. Only one chapter in. But it’s McCarthy doing what he does, and I’m enjoying immensely.  

Like always, please do try to give responses with some length. It’s much more conducive to discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently read the phrase 'i'm scared of bouncing too hard in case I break his dick' a fair few times now so I wanted to share some wisdom to get my fellow cowgirls riding risk free. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, bouncing straight up and down on a dick is tiring. Let's face it. There are ways you can be on top without killing your thighs OR breaking the dick. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's all in the ass and hips. Your ass should be going ten to the dozen but not your legs. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's all about the angle. Wanna bounce? Practice your twerking, you want to twerk on that dick. It helps to put your hands on the bed near his head and arch the small of your back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Getting tired and want to grind? Arch your back and place your hands on his chest. Pretend you are trying to draw a straight line back and forth on his dick with your fanjo. Pretend the top of his pelvis is the edge of your paper. This should hit the clit whilst giving him enough stimulation to get 'there' too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or if you're more of a visual kinda woman and not somewhere public then these are wonderful for demonstrating:

3287,"Hi girls of /r/sex!

As the title already says, I want to represent the girls that can't relate to the common given advice on this subreddit by talking about my personal experiences.

So I've been using Reddit close to 8 years now and I've read this subreddit a lot. Not that it's necessarily bad advice that's being given, but I often felt underrepresented sometimes in the advice that is given. I might be a unique case, but I like to believe that there are people like me
out there. So, at the end of this post I'll give my personal advice to y'all.

So, onto my sexual preferences. This is going to be tmi, of course.

I want to start out by saying that the common forms of foreplay are totally not my thing. I've had multiple partners that all put a lot of effort in my sexual well-being, but being eaten out/being fingered is actually kind of boring to me. I've had times and times again people tell me that they're doing it wrong, but I honestly just don't like really it. I like playing around much more. And by that I mean, stuff like wrestling and kissing about. Directly touching or touching around my clitoris doesn't make me as excited and it's kind of turn off for me. Touching the rest of my body does much more for me.

Then comes the next issue. I'm a one trick pony. Once I orgasm from clitoral stimulation, I'm done. No multiple orgasm. I can't continue sex for long after and it takes me at least half a day to recharge. But that's not an issue to me, because I don't mind not getting off at all. I love the feeling of PIV sex incredibly much and when I don't get off I can have sex as often as I please. I don't really get sore and I like the after sex feeling when I didn't get off.

I'm also someone who likes it rough, fast pace and hard. I've tried doing it slow, but it's just not my thing 99% of the times.

And lastly I want to add that I've never liked sex toys. I've been consistently told on Reddit that I just didn't use the right one. Yes, I've tried a few and no it's not my thing. Visually it does nothing for me (most vibrators and dildos look weird to me and I find that a big turn off ) and I prefer using my hand much more. 

So to my advice that I wanted to give. Look, I know not everyone is going to relate to me, maybe you'll relate to some things, maybe you won't relate to me at all. But the point is, is that when you go out and about to have sex with someone.. just ask what they like. While guidelines can be handy, the girl might prefer something else. You're better off just asking her. 

And also know that you're not a weirdo when you don't really like the things that you think you're supposed to like just because it's the common given advice. Sex is an incredibly personal thing. There's nothing wrong with you when you don't like certain things. It's okay to have other preferences.

Anyways, that's all. I hope you all have a great day/night.   I'm here to represent the girls that aren't like the common advice.",t5_2qh3p,entertainment,"Hi girls of /r/sex!

I'm also someone who likes it rough, fast pace and hard. I've tried doing it slow, but it's just not my thing 99% of the times.

And lastly I want to add that I've never liked sex toys. I've been consistently told on Reddit that I just didn't use the right one. Yes, I've tried a few and no it's not my thing. Visually it does nothing for me (most vibrators and dildos look weird to me and I find that a big turn off ) and I prefer using my hand much more. 

So to my advice that I wanted to give. Look, I know not everyone is going to relate to me, maybe you'll relate to some things, maybe you won't relate to me at all. But the point is, is that when you go out and about to have sex with someone.. just ask what they like. While guidelines can be handy, the girl might prefer something else. You're better off just asking her. 

And also know that you're not a weirdo when you don't really like the things that you think you're supposed to like just because it's the common given advice. Sex is an incredibly personal thing. There's nothing wrong with you when you don't like certain things. It's okay to have other preferences.

Anyways, that's all. I hope you all have a great day/night.",I'm here to represent the girls that aren't like the common advice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/bxcubp/im_here_to_represent_the_girls_that_arent_like/

I was unsure of how he was feeling because it had been a long weekend, maybe he was too tired? So I thought I'd drop a few hints whilst we watched TV before setting up minecraft to play where we would be across the lounge from each other.

I started by being more affectionate, getting as close to him as I could, cuddling him with his head on my chest (with the lowest cut top on so he could clearly see directly down my top) kissing him more intimately than just a usual peck whilst watching TV, squeeze hugging and just moving my fingers gently stroking his arms... nothing yet so I thought I would make it more obvious. 

Next I put my hand on his thigh, at the very top. So close that I was less than an inch away from his dick. Moving my fingers in a gentle tickle kind of motion, sometimes very slightly brushing his penis, showing my interest in touching him so that he didnt think I was just resting my hand there, still nothing. 

I started to think that maybe he didnt want to have sex, maybe he was tired etc etc so rather than straight up groping him and risk feeling awkward for doing so of he declined I straight up asked if he wanted a blowjob, and of course he immediately accepted, that led to the most intense sex and orgasms we've both had in a long time. For me the build up and uncertainty was a turn on in itself and my enthusiasm obviously did something for him, because he came for longer than he ever has!

Afterwards I told him that I had been dropping hints for an hour, explained my thought process during and he was mortified he hadn't noticed. He told me that if I want to have sex literally all I have to do is obviously touch his dick and we will be ready to go any time! 

I feel like I've cheated myself out of so many amazing sexual experiences because we were both muppets, him not noticing and me thinking that my supposedly obvious little hints were enough!

3313,"Last night during spontaneous middle-of-the-night sex, my (18f) boyfriend (20m) and I tried anal.

This was one of my first genuine sexual encounters and so I surprised myself by letting him slide a finger deep in my ass while going down on me. I think I always felt too ashamed to even try playing with my ass on my own (even though I liked the ‘forbiddenness’ of it) and honestly it made me feel just as freaked out as I was turned on.

3314,"I did this with my partner yesterday because I wanted to initiate sex in a new way, and thought about sharing here.
It's a fun game to start with but is also great to initiate sex.


 How the game works:

Put a timer for 7 minute on your phone and ask your partner to lie down comfortably but keep their hands away from you. 
They can either put their arms wide open or behind their neck or any place they are comfortable with.
As the timer begins you need to do anything that makes them touch you. And your partner has to avoid touching you at all costs. 

If you win and your partner touches you, you can ask for anything. 

If your partner wins and can resist you for 7 minutes then they can ask for anything they want. 


 Personal experience :
When I played this, I started slow by sitting on him and leaving heavy breaths down his neck then I kissed his neck and then chest, He was slowly getting a boner but he didn't touch me. 
He won't give in so I started dirty talking and took his shirt off to touch him all over. 
I started dry riding him and moaning and he had to finally give up and touch me by grabbing my waist but he did not let go and just kissed me so hard. And eventually we had some great sex. 


If you're bored of the same old way of initiating sex everyday, just try this today.
You will discover what they like and what they don't. Try everything as it's a game.

I have been pretty sexually active since I was a young teenager. As a bi woman, I've had sex with many people, and I never really enjoyed it. Some times would feel better than others, but I never felt anything amazing. Everything was just okay. I was starting to believe that maybe I just don't like sex. 

But then I met him. I've never felt this way in my life- I'll do my best to try and explain. He agrees with me that our sexual chemistry is powerful He actually mentioned it first, and that is how I realized what was going on.

When I'm with him, I just want to stare at him the whole time- his lips, his eyes, his butt, everything. I can't seem to keep my hands off of him. We live an hour away from each other, and when we're apart all I do is think about his hands on me or the things he did to me while we fucked. These are all amazing, but the sex is even better.

3317,"Id like to share my experience because I wish I had read something like this a month ago.

I [24F] was dating a guy for a couple of months. When things finally became intimate for the first time- I didn’t cum. But he did. He didn’t make an effort to make me cum AT ALL.

I made excuses for him in my mind. Maybe he was inexperienced. Maybe he felt awkward because it was our first time being sexual. No big deal.

The next time we were in bed watching tv and he took my hand and put it down his pants. This lead to me giving him a handjob/blowjob and he fingered me for a minute until he came and again I didn’t. I felt REALLY sexually frustrated.

The only way I can cum is from oral sex. After telling my friend about the whole ordeal she told me to be straight up and ask him to go down on me. So the next time we were in bed, I asked and let him know this is the only way I can cum. And he did, and he was REALLY good at it and I finallyyyy came. So he WASNT inexperienced....

Then, again, the next time we were in bed we were making out and I gave him a blowjob where he eventually came and there was a half assed attempt to finger me again with no oral and I didn’t cum. So now he knew the only way I came was through oral stimulation and still made no effort to go down on me. 

But he was so wonderful otherwise. Smart, handsome, kind. Etc. so I went to reddit for help. I asked my friends for help. But it was a never ending cycle of him cumming me and being sexually frustrated.

What I learned though is that I was blinded by my weird infatuation for his character. He was SELFISH in bed and I soon learned that this was a red flag of his personality because time showed me he was selfish in other ways too. His work schedule was more important than mine. Where he wanted to go was more important than where I wanted to go. And I kept sacrificing - not only my orgasms- but other pieces of myself over and over again.

I don’t necessarily think sex should be “I give so I get”. I love pleasuring my partner even if I sometimes don’t get pleasured in return. But when it’s EVERY time- it shows a blatant disregard from my partner. A partner is supposed to want to make you feel good and care that you’re having a good time too. 

Never again will I let myself be in that situation. And I am acknowledging that part of it was my fault- I need to learn to be more assertive. And I’m hoping that if anyone else reading this is in a one sided relationship- you find the strength to respect and love yourself enough to leave.

Me, being completely new to this and otherwise identified as straight, just couldn't look away from his almost 8"" dick. I told him "" you really dont know what I look like man, your probably not going to enjoy being with me, like this"".  This dude looks at me, smiles, and walked over to me got on his knees and started sucking my dick. WOW.  So that was cool. After that I tried sucking him and gagged a lot.  That was less cool. After about an hour of just rubbing each other he was like ""if you have any condoms I'll try and fuck you, if your okay with that"". I got some came back and just wow. He forcefully, but still gentle, bent me over and started eating my ass until he was ready to shove his cock in.  That part was just a blur.  At first I screamed and was like nope fuck all this not worth it, then maybe a few minutes of him being gentle he bends me against a pole, over the couch, on the couch, on a chair, and finally he lays down and I rode his dick, to the best of my abilities, until he came.  

My take away, 
-All in all gay sex was fun, especially from this model man.  A lot harder than any porn makes it look. And less satisfying after you come.  

-I honestly am shocked that this even happened, he did not need to be as nice as he was.

I was on a find a friend app and started messaging this guy who had one kinda bleary photo, but we had a lot in common so we chatted easily.

I'm talking about expecting girls to be immaculately clean shaven (do I have stories about that, boy!) or the fact that oral on a girl is seen as a little warm up, short and sweet to get on with sex, but guys expect blowjobs to last till our jaws literally get sore. 

Or how there's no room for soft and sensual build up, but it's a rush to jackhammer the shit out of you hoping you cum within a few minutes.

3325,"Heads-up, this is gonna be a doozy of a post because for me it's part debrief, part anecdote, but mostly psychoanalysis to help me put into perspective what the hell is going on. I'll try to be concise but I tend to ramble, but thank you in advance for reading anyways!

I'm 24m and trying to see myself as an adult, which includes finally confronting my sexuality with which I've been largely uncomfortable. I know I'm straight but I realize the way I express my sexuality isn't exactly orthodox, i.e. I've never masturbated nor really ever watched porn. The thought of self-pleasuring myself has always disturbed me for some reason, and what I find arousing is incredibly limited, pretty much just stuff like /r/tittydrop . No dudes, no sex, just girls and boobs I guess. I was overwhelmed by hormones as a kid, and still have wet dreams fairly often, but nowadays my sex drive is pretty much nonexistent. In the rare occasion that I do get ""in the mood"", I go to my subreddits, get hard, feel ""meh"", then go back to whatever I was doing, no climax or anything. Stimulation feels like a chore; imagine eating solely because you're hungry but it doesn't bring you any joy, like eating a bowl of plain cheerios or oatmeal without any sugar.

Well, being 24m and having no romantic nor sexual experience made me feel really insecure about myself, especially after watching *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* where I thought *Oh, God, that's gonna be me*. Because I've been unlucky at love, I've never really seen myself as desirable, like some sexless ""thing"" incapable of love or being loved. Then an offhand joke a friend made stewed into a legitimate consideration: ""What if I went to a brothel to get some experience?""

And that's what I did. I did my research about brothel legality and etiquette, found a girl who's my type, and set up an appointment to see her. In the weeks waiting for my trip, at first I was super nervous/scaroused like I was committing a crime, but ultimately I just shoved it to the back of my mind and didn't think about it at all. When the day finally came, I was surprisingly calm during the whole trip to Nevada.

Once I got there, the lady (let's call her ""Jessie"") greeted me with a hug then we chatted over drinks to get to know each other. And she was really cool! At first, I could tell Jessie had on her ""sexy persona"", but as we got into talking about our geeky interests she really opened up and it was like hanging out with a friend. After a while, I noticed that she suddenly remembered her job then kinda snapped back into ""sexy mode"" and took me back to her room.

Fast-forwarding past the business formalities, I wanted her to take charge so I lied on my back as she straddled me and undressed. Now I guess this is where things started getting kinda weird for me. My entire life I've been especially aroused by breasts. So when I saw hers my mind didn't make that ""AWOOOGA"" sound, I just thought ""Huh, those are pretty neat."" Jessie had pretty good-sized boobs that fit snugly in my hands, and they were super soft but yeah literally bags of fat so I don't really know how I expected them to feel, but they were still really cool!

So this is where my questions begin: does breast size actually matter? I don't even know anymore. I've always thought bigger was better, but now I'm starting to think that all sizes are good. Boobs are fun to look at and play with, but what are you supposed to do with them? How does more volume add to the experience? It's probably because I'm inexperienced in all of this, but this is the start of my sexual preconceptions being totally upended.

I asked if she could teach me how to take off a bra and she thought it was a great idea. So I sat up, Jessie put her bra back on and stuck her chest in my face as I tried to blindly unhook her bra. It was a fun experience, and revealing boobs over and over again never gets old, and this has always been a fantasy of mine. But I gotta admit, I didn't get hard at all during our entire session.

We eventually got naked and I could tell she was trying her best to be sexy for me, but honestly I just had too much fun talking with her. It could have been a combination of being tired from all the traveling, being in a state of calm preceding the event, and being slightly buzzed, but I was incredibly at ease -- maybe *too* at ease? I kept distracting her out of sexy mode and we geeked about all kinds of stuff ranging from Teen Titans to Bionicles to the state of the film industry, I really enjoyed how she listened to me, and I also enjoyed poking her brain and getting to know her better and finding out some of her funny quirks/stories.

Overall, it was like hanging out naked with a really good friend. We didn't end up having sex, I never got that primal caveman urge of ""UNGA BUNGA LET'S FUCK"" but I rather really enjoyed the intimacy more than anything. I loved feeling the weight of her body on top of me. I loved how soft her skin was and how sweet she smelled. I loved holding her hands and intertwining our fingers. But most of all I loved how when she was looking down on me, her hair cascaded around my face and I'm looking up at her and we're in our own little world. We ended with spooning and I really wish we did that sooner. I loved wrapping myself around her and holding her, and for a moment everything felt right in the world.

I had a really great time and it was a good experience for me to have, but now I'm left with so many questions. If having a beautiful girl straddling on me naked throwing her titties in my face doesn't make me rock hard, what can? And why even bother with my lewd subreddits anymore? Why did I feel like talking the entire time? Did I talk so much because I was nervous? Or is it because I still can't view myself sexually and was distracting myself? We never kissed as it was part of the ""Girlfriend Experience"" service that was out of my budget, would kissing have helped me get into the mood?

I did come up with some explanations. Having sex (or at least trying to) was very similar to how I felt about dancing. Dancing with a random partner is simply just going through the motions. But dancing with someone you like, someone you have chemistry with, you have that passion, that spark that turns dancing into something truly wonderful. And I suppose it's the same for sex. I guess I talked with Jessie so much to try and develop a connection with her, but overall fooling around was fun but not exhilarating since we hardly knew each other. But I figure if I was getting intimate with someone I truly had feelings for, then maybe I'd feel UNGA BUNGA.

Labels kinda irk me as my friends always try to categorize me as ""asexual"" or ""demisexual"", but maybe they're onto something? I figured, at the end of it all, I wasn't ever really looking for sexual gratification. If that was the case, I could just wank at home free of charge. But I think I'm ultimately looking for something more, that intimacy of holding another person in your arms and they hold you too, and you have this special connection that only you two share. And I guess I'm just waiting to meet the right person.

3330,"Hello all... So this happened a few moments ago... I'm \[26M\] writing this from my phone on another room while my Fiancee \[27F\] is asleep. 

Basically, yesterday was our relationship's ""aniversary"". We are planning our wedding, but live at different houses with our parents cause of airtight tradition. My brother went out on a business trip and allowed us to stay at his place sporadically for the rest of the week. 

We celebrated by having dinner at a fancy restaurant and then moved into the apartment for some sexy time. We drank a bottle of wine between the two, but then tanked and fell asleep without having any action. I did not expect we would have sex after that, and was fine. At 3AM tho, she woke up and started to flirt with me and woke me up. We started some very nice foreplay and later stood up to have some sex against the wall. 

The harsh part: While having sex against the wall she had an intense orgasm and asked me to pull out quickly. She can often get tired of penetration as she is quite sensible, and that's fine too. However, after I pulled out, she said she felt VERY sick and wanted to throw up. She resisted hugs, aid, and even my presence for a rapidfire event of a minute, while lying helplessly on the floor. She later asked me to help her move to the bathroom, and completely lost her patience at me again when she was at a safe distance from the toilet. She probably said the worst things to me in this quick interval of time, from our very long time together. She made comments about my smell, demeaning snarks at me overall, and outright offensive shit. 

I was floored.

She kept asking at the same time for water and crackers, which I did provide, in order to help relief the stomach sickness. She commanded me to help her dress herself, while making retching noises as she stood as I knelt. I did so, and in the panic remained naked as she used my clothes as some kind of mat. Afterwards she used my legs as a pillow and we remained petrified for a solid 10 minutes.  

I was honestly thinking she had food poisoning, and acted in a very calm way. She finally composed herself and asked if I was fine. I said I was not, but that she being physically ill was a priority. After some moments of silence in bed, she said she was sorry. However, for me the worst part was when she finally said that she said that she was aware about what was  being said the whole time, and was sorry. I was unable to react. After a minute she fell asleep again, and here we are. 

Honestly, knowing she knew all along what was happening and did not stay awake for damage control became my nightmare fuel. I lost any ability to sleep. I lost any wish to have sex for the next month. I don't know what I will say, or which issue I'm going to address first tomorrow. Some of the things she said would destroy friendships or at the very least make anyone cry out of shame/vulnerability. Will this happen again? What the hell was that?

She is usually a horrible sick person, but hell this was nowhere near as her worst case of actual food poisoning (just physical sickness). Why am I so hurt? 

I feel like if she actually puked on me there would be no difference on how bad I feel right now.   Just had the worst sexual experience with my Fiancee",t5_2qh3p,entertainment,"Hello all...

After some moments of silence in bed, she said she was sorry. However, for me the worst part was when she finally said that she said that she was aware about what was  being said the whole time, and was sorry. I was unable to react. After a minute she fell asleep again, and here we are. 

Honestly, knowing she knew all along what was happening and did not stay awake for damage control became my nightmare fuel. I lost any ability to sleep. I lost any wish to have sex for the next month. I don't know what I will say, or which issue I'm going to address first tomorrow. Some of the things she said would destroy friendships or at the very least make anyone cry out of shame/vulnerability. Will this happen again? What the hell was that?

She is usually a horrible sick person, but hell this was nowhere near as her worst case of actual food poisoning (just physical sickness). Why am I so hurt?

3333,"I love my husband deeply. He's my best friend. We have kids and the house with a yard and dogs. It's almost perfect. 

But sex with him is wearing on me. He's overweight and below average in size, and only a couple positions even work for us because of it. My favorite positions are unrealistic and I'm often left unsatisfied. 

Probably because of his weight, he has difficulty getting and staying hard. A lot. I have gotten to the point where I don't even want to try because if he can't perform then there's guilt on both sides and honestly it feels like a chore these days. 

We've tried meds. They've helped some, but it doesn't fix the weight and size issues that bother me the most. 

I feel so bad about all this. I don't know how to kindly explain it to him. I don't want to hurt him but his health is harming our sex life.

3336,"So, like many other men (or women, let's be honest) I've regularly masturbated to porn for most of my life. I'm not here to tell you porn is bad or that you should be saving yourself and cutting out porn, but I do want to share my experience that has naturally taken porn out of the picture because of what I think is a healthy sexual relationship with my partner. 

So a little backstory on the girl I'm dating. She's had some bad relationships, like really bad. Cheaters, narcissistic assholes, abusers... You get it. She is very reserved sexually (emotionally) because of it and almost views sexuality outside of intimate piv as unnecessary and a borderline turn off. Now I understand why, she has many insecurities driving these notions, but when we started dating I was pretty ignorant and indignant to her reactions. Well, a lot has happened over the last few years. I've grown and she has too. I've managed to break through some of those emotional barriers while she at the same time, has allowed them to slowly come down. We've been able to experiment a little and test waters, I've been able to identify her insecurities and cater to them and she's felt comfortable branching out and it's been a great journey. What I've found  is the thing that most turns her on out of anything is when she knows that she's the only one I want, and that she turns me on. 

This is so simple, and I think may be true for a lot of women and men, but it was pivetal in our sexual enjoyment of each other. Once I realized this and started actively putting forth an effort to fulfill this need of hers, our sex life exploded, to the point where I really don't consider watching porn anymore and I get MY fulfillment from the direct results of nurturing hers. One of the things I always wanted was for her to send me sexy pictures for example, to enjoy our sexuality outside of the bedroom and whenever we wanted. When I started focusing on making sure she felt that she was the object of my desire and would see her so turned on by it, It opened doors that were seemingly shut tight. We have been sexting, and sending pictures, and talking about desires and fantasies and I really couldn't be happier with the trajectory we are on. I don't feel the need to watch porn anymore because she is now actively engaging me on a level of sexuality that I want, because I'm actively engaging her on a level of sexuality that SHE wants, and even though I still have pent up sexual energy I no longer feel the need to expel it in a bland jerk off session watching some good porn. I want it to be for her. I'm not trying to say that porn should not be a part of anyone's sexual life. Honestly if porn is a part of someone's sex life and both parties like it, and it enhances, then by all means go and watch some together. I'm just speaking from my experience that I realize may be relevant to some here.

I guess this is kind of a PSA to those out there who are feeling unfulfilled and may be seeking their fulfillment elsewhere other than their partner. I am basking in the results of hard work and dedicated energy toward honing how I relate with my girlfriend through patience, communication, initiative and more patience. I want to say it for those who might need to hear it: you can improve your sex life with your partner. It takes dedication and being serious about forming a healthy and genuine sexual relationship unique to your circumstances, but it can and will be improved by listening and taking appropriate action according to what the specific needs are. I am honestly loving the inactivity on my pornhub account. My girlfriend is all I want right now and she loves it and I love the results of her loving it. It's been a Win-win all around.

3340,"The catalyst for this post is a recent event that happened in bed a few weeks ago. I'd been seeing a lovely young lady for a few weeks who asked if I could be rougher and more dominating in bed. I told her I was fine with it as I wasn't a stranger to it, so long as it was what she really wanted. Fast forward to the night, and during the act; copious amounts of manhandling, slapping, choking etc, I said something to the effect of her being ""too beautiful to fuck like this"". This caused her to break down in tears. After a long time of cuddling, I asked her to share what she was feeling. The essence of the conversation was that this sort of sex was what she'd been exposed to in her teens and early 20s, and had been normalised for her - this is what sex was for her. ""It was just expected"" she told me. She'd never had anyone call her beautiful in bed or care about her pleasure and comfort during sex, which was why she broke down crying at my comment.

But I can't say that this event has even been uncommon since I've been dating again. A few partners ago, I was seeing another great young woman who fell head over heels for me - faster than I was prepared for or felt comfortable with. Again, after a night which started with me cooking her a dinner and chatting over some wine, she broke down crying and shared with me that she had never in her life had anyone interested in her outside of the bedroom. She had only ever experienced, what I could describe as, an agressive hookup culture. 

As I get older, the less I find I'm having fulfilling and enjoyable sexual partners. I reentered the dating pool a few years ago and have found that regardless of whether I'm picking up at a bar, have been introduced to someone through friends, or just meeting someone on the street, sex always ends up with an expectation of some form of domination on the other parties end. In the last three years I've dated nurses, doctors, vets, uni students, backpackers and other people from all walks of society. 

Each partner has opened up to me about some form of sexual trauma. Ex-boyfriends taking sexual photos or videos. Drunken nights when they were sexually abused and raped. Being coerced and pressured into anal sex. Having older partners manipulate them into dominating and submissive partnerships owing to father/parenting issues.

By all accounts, I hit the absolute jackpot in regards to my lot in life. I'm a white male, 6'2"", 200 pounds, perfect health, educated, earn a good living, and am objectively good looking. Yet I cannot enjoy sex and my relationships, because I always feel like I'm taking the role of being a healing partner. I'm always providing this environment to help women explore themselves and their kinks in a safe place. But I don't want to slap women, I don't want to choke them and gag them and tell them they're ""daddy's dirty slut"". I don't want to tie them up and essentially rape them like it's a hardcore porn film. Yet each partner, here I am, filling this role that they want from me.

Long story short, I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed having just some vanilla consensual sex. There is so much sexual trauma and abuse out there in society, and just writing this post of the last few years of my life has made me so angry and turned my stomach.

3343,"So I chased the dream of being an actor as a young theatre student.  While that life is behind me I recently found a project I worked on featured on a major streaming platform.  In it I’m a background actor during a group sex scene.  While I’m not featured I’m in it enough to be picked out if you know my face (I’ve had a few awkward convos about it over the years with friends).  It was literally not sexy at all, everything you’ve heard actors say about sex scenes is true.  For me it was all about money. I was comfortable in my skin and being nude didn’t bother me.  I also did nude figure modeling during the day while bartending at night. 

Anyways, as soon as I saw the show I came clean to my husband so he wouldn’t turn it on and be freaked out.  To my surprise the first thing he did was ask me to watch it with him.  He seemed really turned on and kept asking me questions like “did you get wet?”  “Did anyone get hard or cum for real?”  Ever since then he seems really obsessed with the nude modeling and acting I did. He even said he would love to see me pose for a class again (but I think in his mind he wants to sit in the corner and jerk off). 

On one hand I’m relieved he didn’t get angry possessive or upset but on the other he’s making something sexual out of something that I saw as “another day at the office”.  I feel like he wants to explore this further and while I don’t mind, if I did pose for a class he’d probably not be allowed and, again, it’s not a sexual thing.  I want to satisfy him but I feel like it’s going to be dissaponting.   Did nude work as an actress/model in my early 20s (now 32F).

We had sex when we were high and I moaned quite a bit, to the point she thought I was faking it.

She's not into the whole slut shaming, calling her a whore thing, so I'm really lost as to what I can say when we have sex. Any opinions? Is this the place to ask?

3345,"In my vagina.

I never knew that was possible. But it happened. I had *excruciating* period-like cramping pain and laid around for an hour after we had sex. Waiting for it to go away, it didn't. I felt like I was going to puke or pass out or both. It felt like I was in labor all over again.

I have an IUD so I got scared that it had perforated or partially expelled or something. The neighbor came to stay with the baby and my boyfriend took me to the ER. Which took for *fucking* ever because it's Memorial Day weekend and the doctors were fighting with some drunk guy who needed stitches and didn't want them. We got there around 11. By 2 I had been in a room for a couple hours and *nobody* had been in to see me. Not a nurse, not a doctor, just some guy from registration verifying my name. They didn't give me a hospital gown or blanket or anything for pain, just let me sit huddled up in a ball terrified that my IUD was going to kill me.

Finally I buzzed for a nurse because is was still in pain, in tears, nobody had seen me or given me any indication how long I'd have to wait, and I could hear the hospital staff walking around having conversations about Cowboy Beebop of all things. I felt like I had been forgotten about, was holding my urine because I knew they'd probably need a sample, and scared and anxious to get home to my baby. That finally got the ball rolling and they took a urine sample and got the doctor in there.

They ran my urine to the lab, *finally* gave me a painkiller (at 3 am!), and sent for an ultrasound tech. They did an external and an internal ultrasound. There's nothing more uncomfortable than having a cold jelly-covered ultrasound wand shoved up your vag and wiggled around while you're still in pain. Then I waited for the results.

Everything came back fine. IUD is where it's supposed to be, no infection. Doc chalked it up to a pulled muscle and told me to take it easy for a few days, and to follow up with my OB if the pain isn't gone by Tuesday.

I feel so stupid and angry. Stupid for pulling a muscle and going to the hospital (who even heard of such a thing?) Angry at myself for making a huge deal out of what turned out to be nothing. And also angry at the hospital for ignoring me for so long. I get that it's a holiday weekend and the drunks and crazies were out in force, but the ER really didn't seem that busy. Certainly not so busy that I had to stay in the hallway because the rooms were full. Certainly not too busy that the nurses couldn't stand around talking about Cowboy Beebop. I feel like they didn't take my complaint seriously because I'm a young woman complaining of period-like cramps (I'm 33 but look like I'm mid-20's). When I was finally seen, they kept asking me if I got regular periods and when my last one was, as if they thought it was just my period. Like, I'm **33 fucking years old** and I gave birth 9 months ago and have never been hospitalized for my goddamn period. I'm not a 13 year old going through her first period and being dramatic, if I describe my pain as reminding me of labor *which I've been through*, you better take me fucking seriously. 

Today I'm still having some pain and it's hard to lift my baby. Boyfriend is helping but has a massive migraine from sleep deprivation and stress. We both feel like garbage and my dad won't come help us because my parents have company, and mom can't anyway because she just had foot surgery.

So ladies, be careful. You can pull muscles down there and it *fucking hurts*. And if you do go to the hospital for lady problems, don't be afraid to advocate for your care.

I know what you're doing. It's about as subtle as a teenage boy at a swimming pool, and everyone thinks they are getting away with it when in reality it can be for multiple reasons (not paid enough, social anxiety, actually don't care). This is a very sex positive sub Reddit, so it can be hard to remember that sex can make some people very uncomfortable and causing that discomfort to a stranger in public/at their place of work is really really rude.

It's not just me, there are kids and families and just other people too. All of the above applies to them, and the more people the more likely one of them is going to have a bad time with it. Also could be taking a room someone could need for it's intended purpose. But you go when it's slower it puts more pressure on the attendant.

What I don't know is the specifics. I don't know if you are full on having sex and wiping it on the clothes I'll later have to pick up. I don't know if she is going to swallow and leave no mess. I don't know what you did on that bench, and now I either have to get all up in that room to clean it, or let the little girl that comes after you sit on it to put on her pants. Sure, you might not be the rudest or messiest about it, but it's not like I know that.

You are making your kinks my problem without my consent or any of the others around you. Also, those rooms are filthy af.

And no, not getting caught isn't all that matters. It's about not putting others in a position they don't want to be in and that makes them uncomfortable. Definition of a dick move. Sure, say the odds of you getting caught are slim (not that every time people are caught they know about it.) you are determining for others that your pleasure is more important than the risks for making their day worse.

3500,"Three months ago I was getting upwards of 10 spam calls every day. Pressing two obviously wasn’t working and in many ways I started to feel like a victim because there was nothing that I could do. My phone is used for business as well so I am obliged to pick up on all calls. 

At one point I decided that from then on I was going to start answering every spam phone call with one goal, to waste their time as much as possible. 

I started small, I would ask my friends to give me a random color and I would then repeat that color over the phone until they hung up. Other times I would simply say “uh huh” until they got frustrated. 

I quickly found that all these spam call sites screen their calls from people like me, so I learned to be legitimate until I got the second person.

For my first real attempt I pretended to be an older diabetic man who needed health supplementary health insurance. With this act I made it clear that I specifically needed coverage for my prescription of chocolate sauce. Oddly enough I could get the salesperson to say that could indeed cover my chocolate sauce needs. Ultimately I would let them down gently and then tell them that if they didn’t take me off their list for real that I would waste their time even more next time. 

For my auto coverage I would be legitimate until I got to the second person where I would let them know that I made modifications to my car. When they then asked about these modifications I would straight face tell them that I made the car foot powered. 

Long story short after these and other shenanigans I now get one call a week. I figure they have no incentive to take you off the list until it no longer behooves them to have you on the list. Their time is money, if you spend their time they aren’t going to want to keep calling you. Also that whole victim feeling went out the window once I went a full five minutes explaining how foot powered engines worked.

3533,"posting because i wish i had a quick guide like this, as other articles posted become unhelpful soon after their publication because of facebook's frequent changes to its ux and api. 

this was long overdue because i've had fb since freshman year of highschool and i graduated college 4 years ago. like any sane person i don't post there that much anymore so i considered deleting it entirely but i'm in some cool facebook groups and the event function is good. still, i've always been mildly bothered thinking about how much uncool shit i had posted online deep in my profile just from being a young dumbass. 

so for posterity's sake i wanted to download all my albums &amp; tagged photos of me, stick those on a hard drive, and then pretty much delete everything (old/bad photos, old status updates, posts on friends pages, comments) except a handful of photos. 

facebook certainly doesn't make this easy for you, those sick fucks. it was a couple hour task involving multiple chrome extensions and the added mental torture of looking at cringey old photos and posts. the last thing i'll add is that it was a chore that really put me face to face with how much data/content I unhesitatingly handed over for 11 fuckin years.

Step 1: Use facebook settings to download the photos &amp; videos you uploaded. settings &gt; your facebook information &gt; download your information &gt; photos

fb will make a zip file for you with all of that stuff. 

Step 2: download tagged photos of you. facebook doesn't include these in the zip file you just downloaded, and there's no way to do this in one fell swoop without a chrome extension. install [this bad boy called downalbum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downalbum/cgjnhhjpfcdhbhlcmmjppicjmgfkppok?hl=en), open it while you're on FB, and click the button in the extension that says ""fb open photos of."" i learned that you'll want to scroll to the bottom of the page, so all the photos are loaded, before you run the extension. when its done downloading it'll open a new tab/webpage with all of the photos. save that complete webpage and all the photos you're tagged in will be saved.

you can then drop all the photos so far into a folder / drive.

step 3 (the annoying as fuck part): untagging yourself from all the photos you hate. after a little research there didn't seem to be any functional 3rd party tools that could untag photos en masse. so within facebook go to your activity log, select ""photos"", then select ""tagged photos of you"". there will be a timeline of photos you're tagged in, as well as POSTS you're tagged in, where the poster included photos in the post as well. theyre different. I just focused on removing the former. 

facebook lets you select photos in batches of 10 max (which is better than no batches but still seems intentionally discouraging) and then you can apply ""untag"" to those. When i did it, the UI didnt correct itself to show remove the newly untagged posts from the page, so you just have to deselect the posts and trust that you're untagged and move onto the next 10. obviously the less photos you wish to untag the less it will suck, I had to do like 600 and it sucked quite a bit. 

step 4: delete all posts you've ever written (comments, status updates, posts on friends timelines). it's at this step you really realize that nothing you've ever written on facebook has ever needed to stay on there for a more than a week. download the chrome extension [social book post manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-book-post-manager/ljfidlkcmdmmibngdfikhffffdmphjae?hl=en-US). go to your fb activity log again and select ""posts."" then scroll scroll scroll to the bottom of the page so that all the posts are loaded. use the chrome extension and set your date range and it will delete all the posts (select 16x speed inside the extension to make it go faster). click the various years on the ride of the activity log to make sure it got all of the posts. it will only remove the posts that are loaded on the page, i had to do a few passes of loading posts &amp; running the extension to delete.

optional step 5: actually (not just untag) delete old albums/pictures you've uploaded. pretty self explanatory, just do it in your photos section. i deleted all my shitty old profile &amp; cover photos and just kept a couple recent ones. i also hadn't uploaded any albums in 5 years and the old ones were whack so i just deleted all of em. 

and that's it. my timeline still shows stuff that other people have posted on it going all the way back but now my written history is gone and any photos attached to me are only the ones i want. hope this helps, comment or dm me if you try it and something isn't working and ill try to help. and feel free to comment if you know a better way to take care of any of the steps.

3655,"I have 6 years moving experience, and very often, I come across a house that isn’t prepared properly. That translates to a bigger bill for you, so I’m going to tell you how to cut off the fat of that moving invoice, as well as share some tips and tricks!

---

* Make sure we can access all rooms at all times. The truck needs to be methodically packed, we can’t just grab what is closest to the door. Don’t have us on the clock making pathways before we start anything.

* Take apart your bed frames. This is a low labour intense task, and paying people good money to do it for you is a waste. If your beds are stood up, frame wrapped up, we will clear that room in no time.

* Take down pictures and wrap them. We will do this, but it’s time consuming. If you only have a couple, I wouldn’t stress over it. But, if you have 4 in every room, i suggest preparing them.

* Label rooms and items with numbers or letters. Customers who do this, avoid having to stand at the door and direct us where to put things. I’ve seen people use sticky notes, tape, coloured strings, etc. Any sort of identity mark that match’s up with a room, is going to make the day less stressful for you. It’s not good if we are holding onto a dresser, asking loudly where it goes because you are downstairs doing something.

* Have somebody with us at the house at all times. Not because we need supervision, but so you are there to answer any important questions or make important decisions if a problem comes up.

* Make sure your neighbors know you are moving. If we have good access, we will pull up right to your door. It’s going to be noticeably more expensive if we have to park on the road because of bad access.

* You do not want us to take our shoes off, trust me. Most companies should have floor rollers, to protect the walking paths we take. It’s a unfortunate reality of moving, you might get a bit of dirt on your carpet. We are as careful as we can be, the the alternative of taking our shoes off everytime is much worse. If we have to pick up a item, bring it to the door, put it down, untie our shoes, pick the item back up, bring it to the truck, come back to the door, take our shoes off, repeat...well you can see how that’s going to hurt when you’re paying by the hour. I’ve seen customers protect their carpets with plastic or a old rug before we show up to the new house, which is a good idea.

* If you know of a item that had difficulty fitting into a room or other space, prepare that item if you can. Taking legs off of big couches, popping a door off (takes 1 min to do that), unscrew the ceiling light, pop off a piece of a desk, etc. If it got in, we will get it out, but trouble items can eat up the clock when we have to fight with it. If you know of a trouble piece, do what you can to make it go smoother when we show up.

* Clear all table and counter tops. Don’t look at it as extra space to pack things on for us. Sometimes we will need the item long before we need all the stuff you have put on top of it, which means we have to clear it off to take. 

* If you have a empty vehicle when we show up, pick a item that’s expensive, important, or very fragile, for you to take in your car. If you only have one thing to take in the car with you, it will be safer then us finding a spot for it in the truck. A picture, plant, art, expensive electronics, things like that.

* Make sure pets are gone or locked up. We need the front door to remain open, and it’s also a tripping hazard for us.

* If it is winter, please make sure the walkway has no ice. We will clear it ourselves when we get there, but we are expensive de-icers.

* unhook all electronics and unmount TVs. Just another time saver

Now that you know how to be prepared, here are some general tips and tricks for your moving experience!

* Movers are not responsible for boxes they did not pack. If you want them to be reliable for it, leave the item next to a box when they come, and tell them you need it packed. We are trained to pack and have packing paper anyway.

* Tipping is not expected. It is a nice bonus to get a tip, but it’s not like you are obligated. We understand if you are on a budget and can’t afford anymore then the bill, so don’t feel bad if you can’t or don’t want to tip. In my experience, I’d say 30-40% of people tipped. If you have bad movers, don’t tip them.

* Do not hesitate asking us to move an item you found a better spot for in that room, or another room. Make a note of all the things you want rearranged, and before we finish up, let us know what you would like to be moved again. It’s our job, any good mover will ask you if there is anything else we can do for you before we leave. It’s better to give us a list of things to move again at the end, rather then interrupting our flow during the move.

* When the movers are at your house, you have a nice opportunity to land some side business with them. Any smart mover would gladly rent a truck and come move you themselves for a fraction of the price. Even if you got one item, a shed, hot tub, whatever...Let them know you need a couple strong guys for work in the future, and you can cut out paying the company. You forfeit insurance, but you still get professional movers. If you can see they are good workers, then use them off the books too. We jump at that anytime it’s offered, and we will do it waaaay cheaper then doing it on the books.

* One last little tip, if you brought it into that room in a box, and then built it, remember it might have to come apart to get out. Workout equipment is a big one. Sounds obvious but it can be easily overlooked when something has been sitting in the room for years.

   How to properly prepare for moving day",t5_2qh69,career,"I have 6 years moving experience, and very often, I come across a house that isn’t prepared properly. That translates to a bigger bill for you, so I’m going to tell you how to cut off the fat of that moving invoice, as well as share some tips and tricks!

---

* Make sure we can access all rooms at all times. The truck needs to be methodically packed, we can’t just grab what is closest to the door. Don’t have us on the clock making pathways before we start anything.

* Take apart your bed frames. This is a low labour intense task, and paying people good money to do it for you is a waste. If your beds are stood up, frame wrapped up, we will clear that room in no time.

* Take down pictures and wrap them. We will do this, but it’s time consuming. If you only have a couple, I wouldn’t stress over it. But, if you have 4 in every room, i suggest preparing them.

* Label rooms and items with numbers or letters. Customers who do this, avoid having to stand at the door and direct us where to put things. I’ve seen people use sticky notes, tape, coloured strings, etc. Any sort of identity mark that match’s up with a room, is going to make the day less stressful for you. It’s not good if we are holding onto a dresser, asking loudly where it goes because you are downstairs doing something.

* Have somebody with us at the house at all times. Not because we need supervision, but so you are there to answer any important questions or make important decisions if a problem comes up.

* Make sure your neighbors know you are moving. If we have good access, we will pull up right to your door. It’s going to be noticeably more expensive if we have to park on the road because of bad access.

* You do not want us to take our shoes off, trust me. Most companies should have floor rollers, to protect the walking paths we take. It’s a unfortunate reality of moving, you might get a bit of dirt on your carpet. We are as careful as we can be, the the alternative of taking our shoes off everytime is much worse. If we have to pick up a item, bring it to the door, put it down, untie our shoes, pick the item back up, bring it to the truck, come back to the door, take our shoes off, repeat...well you can see how that’s going to hurt when you’re paying by the hour. I’ve seen customers protect their carpets with plastic or a old rug before we show up to the new house, which is a good idea.

* If you know of a item that had difficulty fitting into a room or other space, prepare that item if you can.

1. I grew up in Florida and moved to Alabama when I was 15. I went from struggling in school to making all As. Because my Alabama school didn’t go over one thing I didn’t already know, except math, which I’ve always done well in anyway. 
2. Florida schools push standardized test, by a lot, compared to Alabama schools. I never took the ACT (for several reasons) but I did take a “compass test” for community college to see which classes I needed to start in.

4. The other day I was going over presidents with my daughter. I try to lastmake learning a game and a conversation. (The game is she gets a quarter for every question she gets right.

Unfortunately, our school didn't plan nearly enough time for the exams (they forgot to factor in the 10-minute break in between sections as well as time to distribute and collect materials), and they decided to hold both exams in the same room back to back. 

So, when the first test finished late, the second test couldn't start on time. Students still received the full testing time, but they had to stay there in the testing room 30 minutes after the end of the school day. 

Many of these students are seniors. Many of them work. Many of them have an off-campus period at the end of the day and thus start work around the time the rest of the students are dismissed. 

These students were told if they left the testing room, their scores would be invalidated. They couldn't get their phones to contact their employers, or their scores would be invalidated. The administrator in charge offered to contact their employers but then disappeared to go do other things. 

Thus, our students were sitting there freaking out, because some of them desperately need these jobs. This is a majority minority school with 90% of students qualifying for free and reduced lunch. Some of these students are helping supporting their families. Some are trying to save so they can go to college--and many are going to be the first in their families to do so.

3685,"Submission Statement: Kamala Harris is probably the first major candidate in 2020 to actually speak on education in terms of policy proposals. I think her plan makes sense and it addresses and issue that many people ignore (despite multiple states having teacher protests) or Roget about because of the 24/7 news cycle. 


Broad Strokes of the plan;

&gt; The Harris proposal, the first from a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to address public education through high school, would aim to provide the average public-school teacher a $13,500 pay raise, an amount Ms. Harris’s campaign said correlates with the gap in pay between teachers and others with similar levels of education.

Ms. Harris would seek to have the federal government provide “an immediate federal investment” to provide 10% of the pay gap and then incentivize state governments to increase salaries. Her plan would have Washington provide 75% of the additional funding for salaries if states agree to maintain long-term investments.

How it will be funded:

&gt; Ms. Harris would fund the proposal by raising estate taxes. That includes making the tax more progressive, “cracking down on loopholes” that let people “avoid paying their fair share” and lowering the per-person exemption from today’s $11.4 million, a Harris aide said.

3721,"This is my 9th year teaching in a non-union state, and my principal (who has incubated poor teacher morale and a fear-based environment in just 3 years) has put me on an improvement plan. 

I was a good teacher before with quantifiable student success and a reputation of being moderately difficult yet understanding and good-humored. The general consensus among my workplace confidants is that I am now targeted by our new principal because, 1) I don't fit the Southern Baptist, SEC-loving, pink-and-teal-wearing mould of our community, and 2)  I'm soft-spoken, reserved, and easy to bully. But the reason doesn't matter.

Because of this high-stakes year full of not only extremely high expectations (differentiate every lesson for each of my 93 students,  incorporate multi-media resources each day, DOK level all questions, submit lesson plans two weeks in advance, get 18-year-old students to read and understand Medieval texts sometime between school, work, and baseball practice, etc.) but also less planning time (observations are frequent and are accompanied by meetings that eat up my entired planning period), I have abandoned my duties in the care of my adored terminally ill mother, any semblance of free time or sense of humor, and leave 90% of the housework and cooking to my A+ husband. 

I've also become dependent on the gross mis-use of Vynase to support the 60+ hours I spend at work and the remaining 10+ hours in which I toil at home each week.

But I'm a great fucking teacher. Fantastic even. Every piece of paper I hand out is color-coded, hole-punched, and artfully crafted by yours truly. My room is absolutely gorgeous. It sparkles with my nature-loving, Birkenstock-wearing style executed with sharp, modern functionality. My two large white boards impress with intricately written anchor notes. My daily agendas are synched to the T with lesson plans. Students are challenged at just the perfect pace to suit their individual needs, complete four separate activities each block to keep them interested, and find an ingeniously crafted online/tactile hybrid escape room waiting for them at the end of each unit for review. Welcome to the well-oiled machine that is British Literature in room B 101.

So thank you to all the ball busting, micromanaging, fear mongering principals out there with nothing better to do than push teachers to their very limits. Enjoy your 150k a year. Have mirth when we drag in each day with grey pallor and thinning hair. Find joy in our panicking nerves as we register the sound of your keys wrestling to unlock our classroom door. Keep on expecting --demanding-- glistening perfection every second of every day and, by golly, you'll get it.

3785,"Perspective: Rising college freshman, recent high school graduate 

College Board plans to eliminate the first 9000 years of AP world history starting in the 2019-2020 school year and instead start the course from 1450 onward. This is a horrible move. While the primary motive behind the move is probably not racism, teaching kids that white people have always been the richest and most advanced, the way they were from 1450 onward, is incorrect, dangerous, and stupid.
 
The earliest sites of human civilization are Iraq, New Guinea, China, Mexico, and Pakistan. Brown people invented civilization. During the years of 500-1300, the world’s riches are in the hands of Muslims, Black Africans, East Asians, and Native Latin-Americans. No kid should be taught that world history is white history. Pre-modern history is important. Don’t stop teaching it. AP World History should be about the history of the world. Not the history of white people’s domination of it.
 
Even beyond the point of race, the first 9000 years of AP World History were worth learning. A great deal of the term papers written in my class were about those years, and my senior thesis was on it as well (Empire of Ghana). Learning these years helped me figure out that my college major (one of the things CollegeBoard tries to do with its AP courses) will probably be anthropology. AP World was valuable and formative for me, and every kid should be able to have that opportunity.

We've had 10 weeks to work on it. I have written about 8 of the 10 pages we have right now. One of the group members wrote paragraphs on topics completely unrelated to our paper's topic, so I couldn't use them at all, unfortunately. The other group member just didn't write much, only a page or so and then edited my grammar.

My professor is already aware of the situation, because I met with him in person two days ago. The gist of what he told me was, ""Suck it up, group projects are tough sometimes because not everyone wants to put in the same amount of work. Good luck."" (He did actually say good luck to me.)

But I could only use about a paragraph of what he wrote, because it was so completely unrelated to the topic we were assigned.",Should I tell professor about horrible group mates?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bx3bmh/should_i_tell_professor_about_horrible_group_mates/
3834,"Sorry if this is a little long this is a complex issue for me and I need to get it all out. TLDR at the bottom if you’re lazy and don’t want to read the whole thing.

I’m currently a sophomore in college studying chemical engineering because I was told that since I was good at math and science, I should major in ChemE. I believed that for a while. I tried joining clubs and talking to professors, but I every time they got to talking about career paths as a ChemE I always zoned out to think about other things that interested me. I figured that it was just my adhd acting up. That it was my fault I couldn’t pay attention while others were readily listening. So I stuck with the major for two years. It has been affecting my grades (having difficulty finding motivation to study), my ability to interact with others (since I can’t find interest in my own major it’s a little hard to find common ground with people within my major), and most importantly it’s been negatively affecting my mental health (I can’t really see a future for myself within chemical engineering, so I’ve been feeling hopeless and depressed).

Recently I started volunteering in lab within my major (still ChemE) which I thought would inspire a desire to go to grad school since I can’t see what I would enjoy doing with just a bachelor’s degree. Again I fell behind because I couldn’t pay attention. And that resulted in me being afraid to ask questions and I kinda started trying to be as invisible as possible, which I think is largely due to social anxiety and a fear of being to harshly judged.

I started seeing a therapist to deal with the social anxiety, and as a result I’ve cared less about how people see me and have become more active within the lab. the last few days I’ve enjoyed it more because I am much more comfortable asking questions and talking to others within the lab since I am less afraid that they see me as baffoon for not paying attention in the earlier weeks. The only problem is, I still can’t bring myself to read more articles and learn more about about what is going on within the lab. I have a much better understanding of the content (so I have the ability to do the readings), but I just can’t find the motivation to do it.

The therapy also got me thinking about why I am so uncomfortable within my major, and got me started thinking about what I am actually interested in. I feel like I am a creative person, and a lot of the time when I am supposed to be paying attention in class, my mind wanders to how I would make a game out of what we’re learning. I took a intro to C++ class a couple semesters ago and I went out of my way to see how many alternative ways I could solve the homework problems rather than following the instructions, and for the most part the class, outside of the lecture, really clicked within my brain. I was never trying to avoid doing the assignments and was always looking for creative ways to complete them. I didn’t tend to zone out while trying to learn either, like I had a habit of doing with chemical engineering.

I also found myself watching a lot of videos on YouTube a while back about timed game making competitions using coding and was really fascinated by the methods the people used to develop their games. 

What I want to do is switch my major from chemical engineering to computer science and specialize in game development but there are 3 problems:

1. I’m already 2 years into chemical engineering, and it’ll probably take 4 additional years to complete a major in  computer science. That’s a lot of time to spend.

2. I am probably one of the more technologically inept people you’ll meet at the moment. The only coding experience I have is a little bit in my first semester, and the intro to C++ class that I mentioned earlier. I get confused easily when people talk about software and how their computer works but I’m willing to ask questions. I’m working on caring less about how people view me and how judgemental they may be. Since I have goals and aspirations I think approaching professors and people already working within the field will be easier than it was in ChemE, which I had a crippling fear of.

3. I also would be walking into the major with a blank resume. Almost none of the stuff that I have done so far relates to video game design, so I’d imagine getting internships or coops related to my field would be difficult as well.  

I’d imagine that making the transition between the two majors would not be smooth at all. There’s a lot of changes that I’ll have to make, but I honestly think it will be worth it if I can be happy doing the career that I end up in. I’m sure that this is what I want to do, the question is how do I go about this transition? Where do I start? I want to try and build my resume as soon as possible I’ll take any help I can get.

Thank you all very much.

TLDR: Don’t see a future for myself in chemical engineering so I want to switch to video game development, which I do have aspirations in, but I am the most technologically inept person you might meet.

3836,"If you're one of the countless people waiting to start college next fall, chances are, you might be someone who stresses out over maintaining a perfect GPA. As someone about to finish her first year of college, I want to impart some words of wisdom: allow yourself to fail once in a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I'm not saying you should *actually* fail (as in, you know, getting an F in a subject). I'm also not saying that you should purposely give up or start slacking off. What I'm saying is that it's important to allow yourself to make mistakes. Don't stress out over every single minuscule detail. Maybe those mistakes cause you to get a B+ instead of an A. It's fine. Let it happen. The learning experience you gain from disappointment is often far more valuable than what you gain by obsessing over perfection. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, no matter how hard you work, it's impossible to always avoid getting a lower grade than you might be hoping for because there are so many factors outside of your control that can affect your performance. At some point, all of us will let ourselves down. When I was in high school, I consistently earned A's on my English papers. However, when I wrote my first college essay, I earned a C+ (or a ""tentative B-"", as my professor put it). It wasn't for lack of trying; in fact, I spent hours planning, revising, and editing that paper. The problem was, I just didn't know how to write a good college-level essay. I didn't have the right experience. Fortunately, my professor was a godsend and didn't record the grades for any of our first papers into the grade book. 

&amp;#x200B;

Earning that C+ was disappointing, but since I've never been a perfectionist when it comes to grades, I was able to get over it within a few minutes (after promising to meet with my professor and talk about what I could improve, of course). However, this generally isn't the case with people who do take their grades a lot more seriously. 

&amp;#x200B;

During my freshman year of high school, I was over at a classmate's house since we had to work on a group project together. My classmate's younger sister (8th grade at the time) was there as well, and as it turned out, she had received her second trimester report card (the old middle school had three marking periods: one in December, one in March, and one in June). I had heard a little bit about her from my classmate, and I knew that she was a straight-A student. However, she had been struggling a lot more in her classes that year, and it reflected in her report card. She earned not one, but *two* substandard (in her opinion, anyway) grades, with a C in honors social studies and a C+ in geometry. When she saw her grades, she had a meltdown and cried for four hours straight. Even after she had calmed down, she was unable to move on from that disappointment for days after the fact. When I saw my classmate next (which was about three days later), I asked him if she was alright, and he told me that their parents hadn't been able to get her out of bed ever since she saw her report card results. 

&amp;#x200B;

My classmate's sister was and is a brilliant student, hardworking and intelligent. However, her refusal to allow herself to fail left her ill-prepared for the inevitable shortcoming. And when it finally happened, when her best suddenly wasn't good enough, she didn't know how to handle it. She got over it eventually, of course, but her perfectionist mindset was much more detrimental to her ability to accept her grades and learn from her mistakes quickly than it would have been if she had simply allowed herself to fall short every once in a while before then. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the thing is, she was only in middle school then. Missing three days of school due to her meltdown was a setback, but it didn't affect her academics too badly. In college, there are professors who will fail you entirely if you miss three days of lectures. You cannot afford to have a breakdown over a subpar grade that causes you to retreat to your bed for days on end, but if you don't know how to handle letting yourself down, it's very possible that it could happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I'm not saying that you should purposely fail. Working hard and doing the best you can is always important. However, don't be afraid of letting yourself make mistakes. If that means you don't earn as high a mark as you wanted, so be it. It won't be fun–it never is–but you learn and grow a lot more from the occasional failure than you do from constant success. Let yourself learn to experience disappointment now, rather than later when not knowing how to deal with it can have much more severe consequences. Your sanity will thank you later.

Even if I got a 0 on the exam, I would still have at least a C. The professor is not replying to emails, since they're moving to a new college this summer.

Can I do anything about this?

3879,"Ask any student and they will agree that exam time is the most stressful, sleep-deprived and grueling part of being in college and with all the work that many students put in they still fail to get the grades they want. I was once that student who worked extremely hard to get good grades yet always fell short until I learned a few critical study habits. I know it's exam season so I wanted to share with you some of my most effective study tricks that you can use to go from a zero to a hero and get the amazing grades that you’ve always wanted.

Back in college, I was a very hard working student. I went to all my classes, read every assigned chapter and put in more hours of studying than I could count. With all of this hard work being put in, you would expect that I would be one of the top students in my program, right? Well unfortunately, this was not the case. Every test and exam I got back was far from being anything to brag about and with only a year left in my program I started to question whether or not a Master’s Program was in the cards for me. You see, I always wanted to be the first person in my family to get a Master’s degree but with these subpar marks, my dream was slowly slipping away. What was worse was that finals were just a month away and these grades would be considered if I were to apply to other programs after my undergraduate degree so I needed to find a way to improve my academic performance in a hurry!

A month before final exams, and I had just been introduced to podcasts which I would listen to on my way to and from class. One day, I was searching new episodes and came across one that immediately caught my attention. It was titled: 4 Study Hacks Top Students Will Never Tell You. Of course, given how desperate I was to improve my grades before applying to grad school, I hit play and began to listen.

The podcast continued playing and finally it got into the first tip which was to focus on the core concepts. It said that many students will read the textbook from front to back and try and memorize every detail while failing to grasp the main concepts at a deeper level which allows them to create more insightful answers on their exam. This point made total sense to me. I would use how much I read as my indicator for sufficient studying rather than what I read. I thought to myself, was I writing poor answers on my exam because I didn’t understand the concepts as well as I thought? I then listened on.

The second study hack was to write down your notes by hand. I laughed to myself thinking this tip was rather antiquated given that typing is so much faster but then I heard an interesting fact. A 2014 study showed that students who handwrite their notes retain information much more effectively than those who type their notes. I figured that typing meant that I was getting more of the information into my notes but it turns out that the act of writing notes makes you process your own wording about the subject leading to better retention. We were two tips into the podcasts and I had a feeling these newly found tips would definitely help with my quest to getting better grades!

Study hack number three was to use Parkinson’s law when studying. Parkinson’s law I thought to myself, isn’t that a disease? Well apparently, Parkinson’s law is the idea that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion” and in the case of studying that involves not setting time limits on your study periods. In essence, by not setting time periods for studying, you are more prone to lacking the focus needed when reading and writing notes since you perceive your study time to be endless. The podcast stated that top students allocated defined periods of time to study where they focus intensely then take breaks to give your brain a chance to process its newly acquired information. I had to kick myself because I was definitely the student who thought that the more hours I “studied” the more prepared I was but in reality what matters more is how focused you are when you crack open the books.

As my commute to school was coming to an end I was then presented with the fourth and final study hack which quite honestly changed the course of my academic career. The hack was so impactful that I still remember exactly how it was phrased by the podcast host, he said “the fourth study hack is to adopt study habits from top-level students”. I spent most of my college career comparing myself to the highest achieving students rather than asking them for tips and advice. After class that day I began talking to my classmates who always scored well on their exams and their tips were instantly impactful in building my own study habits. They mentioned how they would use flash cards to learn key definitions, how they would teach other the content to better learn it themselves and even how they would ensure they got enough rest the night before big exams in order to assure their success.

Two months after hearing this podcast, I was a completely different student. I began to study the pertinent topics of all my courses, cut out all distractions when studying, limited my study periods and continuous searched for better study methods and to my delight I got on the Dean’s list for the first time in my college career and the rest is history as they say!

3894,"I just finished my last final. I'm a double major, Biotechnology and Biology with a minor in chemistry. I started at community college, my AA took 3 years and I really didn't know what I wanted to do. Then I decided I wanted to do Biology and transferred to my local university. Spent a year doing just the bio major, then decided I wanted to add the Biotech major and chem minor after liking Organic Chem more than I thought I would (tips on that below). I worked all the way through, serving and bartending a couple times a week. I took 2ish semesters off somewhere in there, and it took me 7 years total.

If someone told me 5 years ago that this weekend I would be graduating with a BS in these majors, I wouldn't have believed it. I'm a first generation college student and really didn't start believing in myself until fairly recently.

I just want to say to all of you out there, you are capable of way more than you think. If you are even thinking about college, you are smart and you can do it. Challenge yourself a little more than feels comfortable. If it feels scary, that's probably the right place to be. Impostor syndrome is a very real thing. Honestly one of the things that kept me going was knowing that people with less aptitude than me had done what I was trying to do and greater. 

A couple of takeaways/pieces of advice:

**For hard classes or classes that just suck:** try to find something in the material that is interesting to you and latch onto it to get you through. Go to the professor at least a couple times even if you hate them. You'd be surprised at how easy it is to find some common ground if you just go, and they really do sometimes go easier on you if they know you. It sucks, but that's the truth.

**Don't pay attention to what people say** about classes like O Chem or the like, yes they are hard, but they're not impossible, and people hyping them up as being impossible makes it worse. You are capable! You might even end up liking some of those classes if you stop listening to the horror stories.

**For the classes you really *know* are going to be hard,** try to start learning the material a little before the course. I recommend using outside resources like YouTube, Khan Academy, etc. for this. Even a few hours of study a week before the class starts will plant a seed of confidence and understanding that is invaluable. It will help you make some initial connections which will help build more confidence and carry you through the course. But, if you can think a semester ahead to which courses you will likely struggle with and just spend a little bit of time getting familiar with the basics beforehand, it will help you so much.

**Make your sleep and physical health a top priority and a habit.** It will make everything else in your life including school go so much smoother, I promise. I made this possible with work and everything else in my life by only taking 13-14 credit hours a semester, and I promise you it was worth it if you are able to do that. Take advantage of the gym at your school and run to that free health clinic for everything if you're uninsured like me.

**Mental health:** Your university likely has free or reduced counseling available to you, or can point you to a similar resource for students. Don't be afraid to use that. I went a couple times when I was particularly stressed one semester, and on one of those visits ended up connecting with my current therapist (she was a grad student at the time doing student counseling). Best decision I ever made, and I mean that.

**Have fun,** but not too much. Learn when to say yes and no to the fun stuff.

**My favorite apps:** Headspace and Spotify (both have nice student discounts). Pomodoro timer.

**Tl;dr:** You got this. People dumber than you did it. Challenge yourself and be thinking ahead all the time.  Don't take what your peers/students ahead of you say as gospel. Sleep. Exercise. Make use of the resources available to you. Don't take yourself too seriously.

I did meet with everyone of my professors and explained the severity of my situation. There was leniency from them but it was a stressful situation that required my full attention. 

Eventually, I ended up leaving community college at eighteen years old. I am nineteen now and my daughter is two years old, I have help from family, and I want to go back so I can pursue my career path. 

So, I guess to summarize everything, should I go back to community college or apply at a four year university?

College scholarships are mostly based on high school.

3955," 

This is a story about how this spring semester, I got straight A’s in 20 credits worth of classes while also working part time, volunteering, securing a summer internship, trying not to neglect my relationships, exercising daily, and getting 8 hours of sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not trying to “flex” \*hello fellow kids\*, but I see a lot of people asking for advice, especially new students, wondering if their credit load will overwhelm them.  I hope this helps someone.  \*\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A Brief History:**

I am a 25 yo female who just finished my “Junior” year of undergrad. “Junior” because it was my fourth year of college and I have a ton of credits, but I still have a full academic year before I graduate. After high school, I dragged ass and essentially failed out after two years of an unrelated degree (art), took three years off, then went back two years ago for my current degree.

When I left school, I was absolutely convinced that I was dropping out of college, not taking a break. I had anxiety attacks before attending class, felt extremely lost, could barely pay attention in lecture, and struggled with substance abuse. I finished my last semester with a semester GPA of 1.9 and a total GPA of 2.5. Yikes. 

In high school, I was one of those “gifted” but burnt out kids. My teachers always said I was smart, but it was such a shame that I refused *apply* myself. After taking a break from school and doing some soul searching, I decided: I’m a fucking adult, I’m going back to college, for real this time. I’m going to apply my goddamn self. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**About my degree:**

I’m studying public health. To me, my degree is the perfect mix of “hard science” classes and humanities classes. I take classes in the realm of microbiology, A&amp;P, epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. The mix of memorization-style studying and critical thinking, writing essays and discussion style work makes it so that I’m never bored. (I go to a large state school in the northwest U.S. if that matters to you). 

This is the part where someone butts in and says you could never do this with a STEM degree. Sure. Probably not. I’m not saying that every person regardless of major should take my advice, just trying to share what I have learned. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Decision:**

I do a little mental checklist before I assemble a semester’s worth of classes (because advisors are useless- you already *know*). This particular semester, it just somehow worked out that I wasn’t going to be taking any classes that required large amounts of difficult studying. I don’t mean work, but *studying.* That is not to say that I didn’t do any work. I still had shit to do. Readings to skim, essays to write, research to do, the works. But I didn’t really *study*, which takes up a lot more abstract time than *doing.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I took 4 three credit courses and 2 four credit courses. All but two of my courses were 400 level classes with a significant amount of work. (If you’re curious: 3 credit 200 level medical anthropology and a 3 credit 100 level earth science class- my last core requirement)

I like to breakdown my classes at the beginning of the semester based on how difficult I deem them to be. You can usually figure this out by the first couple weeks of class, or after the first graded assignment. How much work will this require time-wise and brain-power-wise, and how big of a hardass grader is the prof? THIS is a big deal. Once I figured this out, college seemed so much more like a game. I would highly recommend doing this, you can reassess throughout the semester and as you learn more about your own grade in the class. I typically write my courses on a sticky note in order of priority and slap it in my planner. Speaking of which:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Planner set up:**

I need a paper planner. It’s absolutely non-negotiable. I could not survive college without one, and you shouldn’t try to. I bring it everywhere. I’ve tried bullet journaling, keeping a to-do list in a notebook, google calendar- none of them compare to the ease of use and accuracy of a paper planner. A typical week in mine looks like [this!](https://imgur.com/a/r5qhd0i)

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the semester, I write the time every class takes place in my weekly spread A4 Target planner. Then, I go through the syllabus and enter every single thing next to when it is due. For each week of the semester, I have two sticky notes on the page. I do this because inevitably things get moved around. In my photo, you can see that the smaller yellow note is for readings, and the large pink one is my ongoing to-do list. The readings being separate is important because otherwise everything gets clogged up, and I can see at a glance what I need to read (or skim, or pretend to have read). I organize my to-do list by class, and have a section for “life”. The first thing I do every morning is look at my planner, and it’s one of the last things I look at before I go to bed. As soon as I sit down in class, I open it up. When making plans with a friend, I open it up. I can’t overstate this enough. Get a planner and use the shit out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Work:** 

I had the unique situation of not having to work that much this semester. I received a federal grant that paid for most of my tuition, scholarships paid for the rest, and my family helps me out with part of my living expenses. This is obviously not everyone’s reality.

The last three semesters, I have worked up to 30 hours each week, and it really is fucking hard. Working takes up a lot of your time and energy, and I wouldn’t recommend working while taking this heavy of a course load. 

That being said, I did still work. I like working. I like having money, I like the structure and I like having something productive besides school to do. In the past, I was an assistant teacher at a private preschool. This semester, I was lucky enough to be able to substitute teach at least one 6 hour shift each week because of my school schedule (Fridays off, Thursdays half off). I also babysat a couple of nights each week pretty consistently. This ended up being about 10-15 hours a week of work- an easy couple hundred bucks in my pocket for rent and nights out. The best part about this situation is that if I was really swamped, I could just completely opt out of work or not schedule anything. When I wasn’t busy with school, I could put in a 20 hour workweek. It put me in control.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Volunteering:**

I taught adaptive skiing on Sundays. I ski with an 8-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and it is exhausting, but rewarding. Our days consisted of me chasing after her, singing songs, managing tantrums, and hoisting her up off the snow. I laughed a lot. Despite thinking that I might over-stretch myself at the beginning, this experience was additive to my life. I felt refreshed, motivated, and happy because I had this kind of volunteering in my schedule. I include this not to brag, but to recommend some type of meaningful volunteering or work if you can. If you think you’re too busy to do good things in the world, you’re not. Promise. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationships:**

You know the triangle. Choose one: sleep, get A’s, or have a social life.

Here’s the thing. I’m 25. Sort-of non-traditional, but I’m still in my twenties. I still have friends who like to go out, still go to shows, stay up too late, etc. But, my friends are also adults. None of my friends who are nurses, teachers, or baristas want to go out until midnight on a Thursday anymore. None of my non-student friends are free in the middle of the day to go fuck around or distract me. When I tell my friends I can’t come out because I’m studying, they’re not giving me shit for it. 

I still made a point to set aside time on Saturday’s to spend time with my friends. Typically we would ski, go out for coffee, or make each other breakfast.  

Another factor in this realm is my boyfriend. Boyfriend works 9-5, so my motivation to not do any schoolwork after dinner was intensified in order to hang out with my person. Boyfriend makes me dinner on nights that I have class until 8pm. Boyfriend gets toilet paper at the store because I’m stuck in the library.  Boyfriend wakes me up with coffee telling me he is proud of me. Can you tell that my love language is acts of service?

I’m not telling you to ignore your friends if they’re distracting and get a partner who does stuff for you, but to consider which relationships in your life are additive and which are less so. It’s fine to have fun and make memories; you’re in college. But if you say yes to every single opportunity, you will find yourself out of balance.

My point here with relationships is this: make sure the people who love you know what is going on with you. Let them know that you want to hang out, but you’re reaching for your goals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Work Ethic:**

For me, relying on motivation alone has never helped me. I need to “hack” my environment in order to do what I need to do. 

I woke up at 6:30 every single day, including weekends. On weekdays, I would arrive on campus around 7:45 and either go to class or go to the library. The quiet floor or the law library are clutch. No coffee shops, no cafeteria, no house. If there is any ambient noise or people having conversations around me, I cannot function. I am there to do work and focus. If you’re only half-working, you’re spending twice the amount of time on work. I straight up didn’t have the time to only half-work.

In a typical day, I will sit down at a desk, open up my planner and my laptop, decide which item on my to-do list is the perfect combination of “finishability” and time-urgency.  My phone is on grey-scale and I deleted my social media apps this January and haven't looked back. I listen to 432 Hz white noise music in noise-cancelling earbuds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m very bad at time. My brain does not conceptualize it passing. I wear a watch religiously, and set timers for everything- Otherwise I get sucked into the hyper-focus wormhole. I set a ten minute timer to get set up and decide what to do, otherwise I will agonize about what the “perfect” thing to do is. Then, I set a timer for 30 minutes, and lean into whatever I have decided to do. After this, I take a break, walk around, take my earbuds out, get some water or coffee, but do not turn my phone back on. And repeat. Before I know it, my work is done or it is time to go to class.

&amp;#x200B;

If I don’t have anything to do, but it is still “work” time, I will research grad programs, apply for internships, go to professors office hours, or read about work that people I admire do. This paid off in the end of the semester, as a professor casually mentioned that I would get along well with another professor in a different department. I meet up with Prof #2, she was impressed that I had already read about her work and offered me a paid summer internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Exercise:** 

Exercise is another non-negotiable in my life. I have border-collie level energy. I need to exercise. If I’m feeling overwhelmed, tired, or stuck, a run almost always helps. I lift weights 4 days a week, my routine usually takes about an hour. I either Nordic or downhill ski with my friends on Saturdays, volunteer on Sundays, and have two hours of yoga a week built into my schedule. No exercise = poor sleep = too tired to workout = eat like crap = I can’t focus= I get overwhelmed= whole system falls apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What I did that actually helped me succeed.** 

* Campus library is my “office” from 8-5 every single weekday. 
* Paper planner is your BIBLE.
* Delete social media. Turn off your phone. Really.
* Work in chunks. For my brain, 30 minutes with a timer and then a small break is ideal. 
* Prioritize, prioritize prioritize. You’re going to have to bullshit some assignments and toil over others. Make your efforts count.
* If you don’t think you have any school work to do at any given time, you’re wrong. You can always work ahead. 
* Habits trump motivation every time. Motivation wanes, but if you’re in the groove, you’re way less likely to fall behind. 
* Never. Ever. Ever. Skip. Class. 
* This seems obvious, but do every single assignment and every single extra credit opportunity, no matter how minuscule or annoying. 
* Support system. Tell your friends &amp; family what you’re trying to achieve and let them know how they can *help* you.
* Don’t forget to feed yourself and exercise.
* Set aside intentional time for non-school. Ideally a full day on the weekend. 
* Say no. Say NO. Explain yourself, be kind, but say fucking no. 
* Nobody is productive every single hour of every day. It’s ok. Perfect is truly the enemy of the good. 
* Have an end goal. Visualize walking at graduation. See your GPA climb.
* If you’re a non-traditional age considering going back to school- do it. School is infinitely easier with an adult brain, adult friends, and adult priorities. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, if you fucked up this semester, its ok. It really is. I’ve been there. My sophomore year, I ended the spring semester with one D, two Cs, an F and a W. It doesn’t feel good. Just remember that it doesn’t say anything about your worth as a person. Beating yourself up about it isn't going to help in the long run. You are not forever the person who fucked up, and you can use what you did wrong to learn and grow and change. 

Also, remember that succeeding and trying your best doesn’t have to be miserable. You can still enjoy the things that bring meaning to your life while trying to do something difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I got a 4.0 while being busy. It didn’t suck because I had a perfect storm of mindset, abilities, organization, and circumstance.   I got a 4.0 while taking 20 credits and didn’t hate my life. Here’s how.",t5_2qh3z,career," 

This is a story about how this spring semester, I got straight A’s in 20 credits worth of classes while also working part time, volunteering, securing a summer internship, trying not to neglect my relationships, exercising daily, and getting 8 hours of sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not trying to “flex” \*hello fellow kids\*, but I see a lot of people asking for advice, especially new students, wondering if their credit load will overwhelm them.  I hope this helps someone.  \*\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A Brief History:**

I am a 25 yo female who just finished my “Junior” year of undergrad. “Junior” because it was my fourth year of college and I have a ton of credits, but I still have a full academic year before I graduate. After high school, I dragged ass and essentially failed out after two years of an unrelated degree (art), took three years off, then went back two years ago for my current degree.

When I left school, I was absolutely convinced that I was dropping out of college, not taking a break. I had anxiety attacks before attending class, felt extremely lost, could barely pay attention in lecture, and struggled with substance abuse. I finished my last semester with a semester GPA of 1.9 and a total GPA of 2.5. Yikes. 

In high school, I was one of those “gifted” but burnt out kids. My teachers always said I was smart, but it was such a shame that I refused *apply* myself. After taking a break from school and doing some soul searching, I decided: I’m a fucking adult, I’m going back to college, for real this time. I’m going to apply my goddamn self. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**About my degree:**

I’m studying public health. To me, my degree is the perfect mix of “hard science” classes and humanities classes. I take classes in the realm of microbiology, A&amp;P, epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. The mix of memorization-style studying and critical thinking, writing essays and discussion style work makes it so that I’m never bored. (I go to a large state school in the northwest U.S. if that matters to you). 

This is the part where someone butts in and says you could never do this with a STEM degree. Sure. Probably not. I’m not saying that every person regardless of major should take my advice, just trying to share what I have learned. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Decision:**

I do a little mental checklist before I assemble a semester’s worth of classes (because advisors are useless- you already *know*). This particular semester, it just somehow worked out that I wasn’t going to be taking any classes that required large amounts of difficult studying. I don’t mean work, but *studying.* That is not to say that I didn’t do any work. I still had shit to do. Readings to skim, essays to write, research to do, the works. But I didn’t really *study*, which takes up a lot more abstract time than *doing.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My Classes:** 

I took 4 three credit courses and 2 four credit courses. All but two of my courses were 400 level classes with a significant amount of work. (If you’re curious: 3 credit 200 level medical anthropology and a 3 credit 100 level earth science class- my last core requirement)

Mods, please delete if this isn't allowed and I apologize. I'd love to get a thread going about designer ""dupes."" I don't mean designers or manufacturers that shamelessly copy from other designers and sell it as their own, but brands or specific items that captures the overall ""aesthetic"" or vibe of another more expensive brand for less. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I love Reformation and Realisation Par and have ordered from both many times. I have a hard time finding anything with the same quality construction or attention to detail as these two brands (ie. I know I can get a floral mini dress off Asos, but it's not going to be silk or sturdy linen, the back zipper won't lay as flat, etc). I'm about to bite the bullet on a dress from Eggie who is also based out of LA, but I'm unfamiliar with the company and a bit nervous. I would love to find other brands that do feminine, slightly sexy summer dresses with good construction that fit TTS (and of course it's a bonus if it's a little more budget friendly).

I recently watched ""Hail the New Puritan"" and was extremely inspired by the outfits Leigh Bowery made for Michael Clark and his troupe. Bowery was an Australian designer and performance artist who has been a massive inspiration across the (queer) fashion world, from Boy George, to Lady Gaga, and of course, drag. When you say ""maximalism"" or ""avant-garde"", his is the first name I think of. His work swiftly blurs the lines of kitsch and high fashion, questions gendered clothing, and oftentimes asks if clothes can't also be sculpture.

I wanted to make this album not only because I love his work and because it's pride month, but also because here at FFA we have a severe shortage of really ""out there"" fashion. Even blogs talking about ""maximalism"" completely miss the mark lately. Because of my ADHD, I tend to lean on minimalism myself and I love wearing black, but it's time to spice things up.

It is interesting to see how the style of the character is shown through fashion that is also functional and moveable. Without further ado, here they are, I hope you like it. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Evelyn from The Mummy](https://imgur.com/a/hNItPMb)  I love that her style is very Boheme and classy at the same time. She sticks for neutrals and classic pieces, but her outfits always have a twist of some sort (white button up with stripes, black dress with a big belt, etc). I also like the change her style goes through. In the first movie, she has a really preppy style with hair up and classy accessories with minimal makeup. In the second movie, she is wearing bold accessories and wears darker makeup and acts more confident overall. Her style is very easy to incorporate into one's own style.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ripley from Alien](https://imgur.com/a/CyOjTBc). Ripley's style is very functional. Her outfits are not necessarily 'her style' in the sense that they are her work clothing and something that she wears in space but I like the theme anyways. A lot of earthy and cool tones with moveable clothing. I love her characters no BS attitude and I think that confidence shows through her clothing and she carries all the outfits so well. One could grab some inspiration for long-lasting basics from her style. Think a denim button up, cargo pants, boots, white tee.

&amp;#x200B;

[Rey from Star Wars](https://imgur.com/a/RAEAK55). Rey's style is functional and movable. Natural colors and natural fabrics with wrap details, arm warmers (or whatever you call those?) and layers. Her style would be also pretty easy to incorporate by choosing the same colors, details or both.  I also like the fact that her style is pretty much the same in different climates, but with more layering. Think a wrap top, linen pants, brown/beige boots, and a loose fitting coat. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft](https://imgur.com/a/jGx7ts1) I feel like Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft has one of the classic biker girl badass type of styles. Her style is very athletic, moveable and functional. Her outfits are probably thought out with the question 'can I fight in these?' I know Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft movies were kind of a flop apparently, but I personally love them. Her style is very modern/can be copied with modern pieces. Think a biker leather jacket, classic tee, black jeans, and biker boots. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Alicia Vikander's Lara Croft](https://imgur.com/a/LUKX4OS) I feel like Alicia Vikander's Lara Croft is like the baby sister of Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft.

4009,"I believe this is my first time posting here, but I had some fashion-minded thoughts and wanted to share them. 

I've recently begun watching Downton Abbey with my family for the first time, and one of my favorite characters just died rather suddenly. For what felt like the umpteenth time, the family hauled out their mourning clothes. It got me thinking. When I normally read about mourning clothes in books, it's a character complaining that black isn't their color or that their dearly departed hated seeing people depressed or any other reason to be against it. 

But--and this *is* going to be very silly--I suddenly felt the urge to wear mourning clothes too. It was only a TV show character, and I'll have forgotten in a few weeks. But I got the funny feeling that I wanted to grieve and have others know and grieve with me. I thought back to all the times I had something catastrophic happen to me or my family and how the current culture seems to be that you dress up anyways and maybe have a few dramatic breakdowns before it all fades away. There's just something more *structural* to a mourning period. The idea of putting on all black and being allowed to grieve, openly and fully acknowledged, seemed quite therapeutic. 

I did a little research. There seems to be a few companies that sell little black ribbons and armbands or elastic bracelets for children (and one site that sells plain black and white tees with text that says something like ""I'm mourning my father, please respect my grief"" that though thoughtful were hideous.) One could just wear all black, but I'm sure the message still wouldn't get across silently. Even if someone were aware of the situation, seeing someone in all black in modern times seems like the sort of thing they'd do on a sitcom to make fun of the overemotional character whose new plotline is to ""get over it.""

She recommends coming up with your own personal color palette. Even though her style could be considered minimalist, she doesn't push that at all onto these worksheets. It made me think of my husband. He is definitely not the most fashionable man on earth, but he has a good understanding of what is and isn't flattering on him. He intuitively gets rid of clothes that wash him out, and when he tries stuff on, he carefully considers if the colors look good on him, if he feels confident, etc. I know he likes flashier styles with brighter colors and bold patterns on other men, but he understands that stuff would just wash him out or that certain cuts would make his slim shape look completely scrawny. He loves street style, but he knows what things would look silly on him, and what would work. I totally struggle with not wanting to imitate every tiny thing I like, so I admire him for his self-honesty.

4020,"Hip dips are indentations that occur when one's hip bone is located higher than his or her femur, causing fat and muscle to cave inward. Because it's human anatomy, a lot of women have this, but it can be exaggerated in some women more than others.

I created an album with a few examples [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/zhEzIlx). There are some bikini shots, so it’s NSFW.

This has been something i’ve personally been insecure about since middle school, because mine always stuck out severely in proportion to the rest of my body, and i’ve still never really figured out how to properly dress for them.

I searched this sub for other threads on this topic, but they’re all 4-6 years old, so I thought it was time for an update.

Personal observations about fit:

* high waisted jeans can smooth out my sides a bit, but my thighs eat them up and I always end up with a cameltoe (I’ve tried sizing up, tried tall or petite sizes, i’m not really sure why this is common with my proportions) not sure if relevant, but i have a kind of flat butt too.

* Midrise jeans are actually the worst, because they hit my body right in the middle of my widest part and it creates a severe indent.

* Body con dresses are a no-go

* Idk why but wearing shirts that land at the hips (which is how 99% of shirts are supposed to fit) look strange on me. So i either wear body suits or high-waisted jeans with crop tops.

* I often tie flannels/denim jackets around my waist to hide the shape of my hip dips.


But those are all just personal preferences. I have no idea if i’m actually making my silhouette better or worse, or if there are other tips, advice, styles that can help with the appearance of them.

The Arcadia Group was one of the companies that did not sign the Bangadesh Worker Safety deal back in 2013 after the terrible factory collapse of Rana Plaza. Not that it matters now anyway, because that deal was apparently a big ol' PR stunt that didn't bind the signed parties to actually contribute in any way if they just paid their way into it to look good.

Even further to that, the alliance ceased to operate in December 2018 and was only a 5 year deal.

Can't say I'm mourning for an old sexist white dude losing his billionaire title on the Rich List. The Arcadia Group was one of the companies that did not sign the Bangadesh Worker Safety deal back in 2013 after the terrible factory collapse of Rana Plaza. Not that it matters now anyway, because that deal was apparently a big ol' PR stunt that didn't bind the signed parties to actually contribute in any way if they just paid their way into it to look good.

Even further to that, the alliance ceased to operate in December 2018 and was only a 5 year deal. And we still have people working in awful, dangerous working conditions making clothes for the Western world and nothing's changed. ¯\_(ツ)_///¯ (Pulling this from [Aja Barber's Insta](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx2BKN8J1l6/) so credit goes to her.)

Background:

&gt; As she prepares to launch Fenty, the fashion line she has created in partnership with LVMH2 — the first luxury fashion house the conglomerate has created from scratch (which will begin sales at a pop-up in Paris on May 24, then be fully available at fenty.com on May 29) — I wanted to discover what lessons she had to offer as she carried that confident otherness deeper into the nonmusical work she has been concentrating on this decade.

Interesting tidbits:

&gt; the Fenty brand is hoping to disrupt the market not only by channeling the imagination of a black woman but by revolutionizing the luxury distribution model by **focusing on direct-to-consumer online sales**. This allows Rihanna and her team of collaborators the freedom to drop new additions to the collection — which includes sunglasses, shoes and other accessories — every few weeks, like singles from an album. 

&gt; *What is the Fenty person’s relationship to masculinity and femininity?*
&gt; 
&gt; RF: I use myself as the muse. It’s sweatpants with pearls, or a masculine denim jacket with a corset. I feel like we live in a world where people are embracing every bit of who they are. Look at Jaden Smith,20 Childish Gambino.21 They dare you to tell them not to.

Actually, that's not the point of this album at all. The point of this album is to demonstrate the ways in which we can use a basic template (jeans and a black tshirt) to create a variety of styles.

The things I think that are worth noting when looking at these outfits as a group are:

- Overall silhouette

- Cut and drape of the shirts

- Necklines and sleeves

- Fit and length of the jeans

- Jackets, shoes, accessories

- Grooming choices (makeup, hair, etc.)

- Texture (distressed denim, different fabrics for the shirts, texture of additional wardrobe pieces, etc.)

- How the pieces are styled (tucking, knots, cuffing, etc.)

How do you like to add variation into your outfits? What do you do beyond switching up things like item type, color, and pattern to create variety within your wardrobe?

Can “statement” items in interesting cuts, styles, fabrics, or patterns be just as versatile as a black dress or a white dress shirt? 

I like seeing the capsule wardrobes that [Daria Andronescu](https://wonder-wardrobe.com/blog-wonder-wardrobe) puts together using pieces that are mostly non-basic, but pair well and look timeless. I also like seeing people IRL who wear the same statement jacket or funky blouse all the time.

I’d like to embrace this mentality more in the way I dress - to have more fun with my clothes, to wear the pieces and styles that I find aesthetically pleasing - while maintaining a closet that is appropriate for my lifestyle and is not too excessive in quantity. 

My questions to FFA readers: How do you feel about this wardrobe approach? Do you rewear the same non-basic items on a daily basis? How do you do it? Do you (like me) hoard beautiful pieces that you hardly wear because it’s more work to style than something simpler? Discuss below.

4050,"Yesterday I found myself going to see “The Hustle” starring Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson with my mom. I hadn’t even heard of the movie and it didn’t get good reviews (it was fine but not great), but damn if the the Costume and Wardrobe department didn’t do a fabulous job on Anne Hathaway’s looks! I mean I was floored by the looks every time she came on the screen. I looked online but couldn’t find any articles about who designed the pieces, but I’ve never tried to do that for a movie before so if anyone can point me to a source it would be appreciated. Here are some of the looks I was able to find pictures of:

[Zebra silk kimono](https://imgur.com/a/xcBv2oX) - She’s wearing this fabulous goldish kimonos with actual zebras printed on it and I need it. 

[White suit look #1](https://imgur.com/a/ud5hrlq) - The sunglasses (she wears them throughout the movie, the hat, the hint of the pink shirt!

[Another white suit look](https://imgur.com/a/7U47MUd) - I love the blazer with no lapel. 

[White dress from the Train](https://imgur.com/a/7NhNFrg) - I died for this look. 

[Another white dress](https://imgur.com/a/P2jPLRx) - The lace details are everything!

[White bandage dress](https://imgur.com/a/Ist0jYG) - I don’t even normally like bandage dresses but this was fabulous.

[Romantic feminine blue dress](https://imgur.com/a/39OPVkT) - this was actually one of my favorite looks but I couldn’t find a picture where the bodice was showing and it was the best part by far.

[Ruffle printed dress](https://imgur.com/a/PcLJniP) - Another fabulous feminine look.

[Sequined Clubbing Dress](https://imgur.com/a/4R4fPyH) - She pulled this off wonderfully.

[Crazy Striped Suit](https://imgur.com/a/oERVrJt) - So our there but she nailed it.

I loved how the clothes in the movie really told a story. The character had such a distinct, classy look when she was playing her true self, but then when the scenes were of her running cons the clothing shifted to match what the person she was playing would wear. 

Honorable mention for Rebel Wilson - she spent most of the movie in ridiculous outfits, but she was a complete stunner in [this sequined gown.](https://imgur.com/a/ZDkvXDC)

Of course, not everyone who wears a thumb ring is WLW and not everyone who wears Perry Ellis is a violent neofascist. But fashion *is* used as a signifier of being a member of a subculture or group.

4077,"Oof, okay, I'm going to take a while typing this post, so here's hoping it meets all the rules!

I'm about to move to a new apartment, and I'm taking the opportunity to review my wardrobe and maybe downsize a little before the move (but I'm not looking to totally decimate my wardrobe, or anything). Definitely interested in feedback!

[Visual wardrobe link](https://imgur.com/a/clxPMVu) \- maybe semi-NSFW because there's a couple bodysuits in there w/ no pants. (Also - I don't own two identical Riverdale shirts, I just accidentally put it in there twice).

If it's helpful, here are some points of reference for what I'm going for, but I have mixed feelings about some of the looks they post: [Luanna](https://www.instagram.com/luanna/), [Gemma Stafford](https://www.instagram.com/gemstafford/), [Amy Valentine](https://www.instagram.com/amyvalentinex/), [Meghan Ceallaigh](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwBM8kBgN2S/), [Mariana Fernandes](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvw9skKnZ3D/) (and as a related question - if you have any recommendations for similar IG accounts that are less... uh... caucasian... I'd appreciate it).

I'm still in the review process and welcome any input you have, but here are my early takeaways:

1. **I'm trying to look more intentional, but the items that ""spark joy"" are not my nicest items.**  
I'm generally not much of a Marie Kondo gal, but while I was trying everything on, I definitely felt more joy holding some items than others. I love all my stupid band and graphic tees more than I thought I did, so the ongoing puzzle is figuring out how to wear those and look a little less sloppy. [Using this photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKYenaHIP0/) as a reference to take care of this point as well as my next problem, which is...
2. **I have no idea how to wear dresses and skirts.**  
I own a lot of dresses, and I thought I had moved past the immature skate punk ""Dresses are gross!"" attitude of my youth, but trying all of these on revealed how rarely I wear dresses. I just wore dresses and skirts every day in April, and it was HARD, and I didn't like it. On the one hand, I'm going to just embrace that I'm a pants gal. On the other hand, I'd like to get better at wearing dresses and skirts.
3. **A subset of the previous point - I own three almost identical black skirts**.  
Whoops!
4. **A lot of these pieces** ***should*** **give me the outfits I want, which means I'm not styling/accessorizing them as well as I could.**   
I thought I didn't have the right clothes to achieve my desired look, but it turns out, there's a lot of the right stuff here. [My outfit](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuphmbanCUo/) is pretty similar to [Luanna's outfit here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwUxMEQhnKD/), but hers is accessorized way more intentionally (unrelated - in general, her outfits are tailored like perfectly to her body, and I don't know how to get to that point! I go to tailors and stuff, but I never get my pants that hi-rise. Kills me). I've really been trying to dress better, but boy oh boy I still have a lot to learn!
5. **A subset of the previous point - I gotta get better accessories.**  
I didn't include any accessories in here because I don't really like the ones I have. This is where I can definitely do the biggest purge when I move. Also, I'm trying to buy less stuff this year, and I won't feel as wasteful buying jewelry as I would, like, another crop top.
6. **I like my fits overall, but some items aren't doing me any favors.**  
At least getting rid of A20, C8, E1, E5, E6, F11, F20, G4, H1, H3, H11, L19, N8, and N2. I picked up a copy of The Curated Closet, and I'm going to use that to review the rest of these items.
7. **I have a lot of pieces that aren't really intentional with what they want to be.**  
I'm talking here about sweaters that aren't really oversize or regular, pants that aren't really high-waisted or not, tees that aren't really fitted or baggy. I'm going to need to figure out how to either style them or alter them, and if neither of those is an option, obviously I'll have to get rid of them.
8. **Many of these items were purchased when I worked in an office, and now that I've decided I'll never work in an office again, I need to figure out what's still useful to me.**  
Looking at you, cardigans L1 and L2.  Shirt C6 - you're on thin ice.

Other than the price and placement of the seam from the front to the back, there’s not much of a visual difference without seeing them in person. Using the websites, it’s clear these Kit2 shoes are Made for discount and are a cheaper version of their Emiline shoes. Hopefully this isn’t in dispute.

DSW sells other many shoes. Nike, adidas, Reebok, Kate Spade, Sperry,  Cole Haan, Rockport, Keds, Converse, etc. Are **all** of these shoes Made for discount or only a subset? If it’s a subset, how would you know which is which? I’m not against discount shopping, but I’d like to know what I’m buying. There’s literally no way to know this in-store as the lawsuit claims.

Does DSW only sell “Made for discount” or outlet shoes?",t5_2s8o5,fashion,"Disclosure: I had another post on this but I deleted it because I used the term “knockoff” to describe the practice of creating a secondary product line using cheaper materials and/or manufacturing to be sold at discount stores. Here’s an article on this practice. [Racked article: “Buyer Beware: What You're Actually Getting at Outlet Stores”](https://www.racked.com/2014/10/8/7573957/outlet-mall-stores)

I deleted the other post because the term “knockoff” was creating a lot of confusion and distraction. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience/confusion from that post to this. From here on out, I’m using “Made for discount” as was suggested.

I am singling out DSW because, while other companies do this, I stumbled across a class action lawsuit naming DSW as the defendant in CA.

The biggest question I have is how to we age up the looks we’ve loved in our 20s, without totally overhauling and losing the parts you love?

For example, I landed on a sort of hipster punk rock princess look that allowed me to be edgier some days and daintier other days without “betraying” my overall style. However, now that I approaching 30, I feel like the overall look is a little too “young.” I’m lucky that I work in an industry that lets me dress however I want, so that’s not a concern. But I still am starting to feel that pull to start dressing a little more grown up without sacrificing entirely the style I’ve come to love. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to do that lol

How have you taken your younger style and aged it up without taking away the aspects you love? Is it easy to do, or is it closer to a total closet revamp? Any tips or tricks?

4090,"Mama Cax is a Haitian American model and disabilities advocate. Her style seems to be heavily focused on vibrant colors, funky sunglasses, and suits. My favorite things about her style: 

1. Her sensibility about patterns is really unique, with her use of them often for the purpose of accentuating a specific color. Even when a patterned piece is the largest part of an outfit, it seems that the patterns accentuate and highlight the color of her accessories rather than the other way around. 

2. She views her prosthetic leg as it's own accessory, with coverings that she changes to match her outfit. Instead of hiding her amputation, she makes it a central part of her self expression. 

She also frequently utilizes daring color combinations that most people wouldn't try.

We’ve all been there:


You’re in a public space minding your own business when a man approaches you and says “You’d be so much prettier if you smiled.”


You decide to hop on the mom jeans trend and Karen needs to make it known that she finds them unflattering on you.


You’re running late to work and didn’t have time to apply makeup, your coworker tells you that you look sick. A few days later, you wear your new bright purple lipstick and are told you wear too much makeup. 


You wear a springtime flowy baby-doll top that you felt cute in until you were asked by 2 people when your due date is.

4097,"For those who live in colder climates, are you as excited as I am for bike weather??

When I'm not riding for sport, I've always loved cycling in dresses and skirts - there's nothing better than feeling a cool breeze on my bare legs as I zip down a city street. My style also shifts a lot from winter to summer so by this time of year I'm pretty eager to trade in wool pants for silk and cotton skirts. 

My favourite cycling outfit is a skirt that hits above the knee with some stretch or serious slits, some spandex shorts, a top in a breathable fabric, and some sort of light button down or duster to keep the grime of construction away. I also like loose button down dresses that can be unbuttoned and/or tied at the bottom. Most of my wardrobe is pretty neutral which complements my bright blue bike.

Cycling in Skirts + Dresses (Inspo album, tips, what's your go-to ""cycle chic"" outfit?)",t5_2s8o5,fashion,"For those who live in colder climates, are you as excited as I am for bike weather??

When I'm not riding for sport, I've always loved cycling in dresses and skirts - there's nothing better than feeling a cool breeze on my bare legs as I zip down a city street. My style also shifts a lot from winter to summer so by this time of year I'm pretty eager to trade in wool pants for silk and cotton skirts. 

My favourite cycling outfit is a skirt that hits above the knee with some stretch or serious slits, some spandex shorts, a top in a breathable fabric, and some sort of light button down or duster to keep the grime of construction away. I also like loose button down dresses that can be unbuttoned and/or tied at the bottom. Most of my wardrobe is pretty neutral which complements my bright blue bike.

I used to have closets full of clothes that i LOVED and I was creative with putting together outfits.  I loved getting dressed.

I know certain things I like, but I feel so far from who i used to be.  I went through a very long, drawn out, heartbreaking breakup a few years ago and when i did, I pretty much got rid of everything from my old life if that makes sense.  Including my clothes, shoes etc.  I didn't want any of it anymore, because it reminded me of a life I didn't want to be reminded of.

Now I am down to one closet and one dresser but I feel like it's a mish mash of things and not complete.  I no longer look in my closet and think this would be a great outfit, i can't wait to wear it.

Is there any way to get back to that or does anyone have any advice on how to slowly piece together a wardrobe I'm excited about again.

* No shiny/patent leather. I don't know why I do this but it extends to me avoiding any glossy lipstick as well. I guess I don't like the glare?
* Flannel shirts have to look 'complex' (?) for lack of a better word - they can't have uniform stripes or big chunks of white and need to be 3+ colors. Also not sure where this came from. For example, [this shirt](https://imgur.com/bPg0Ak4) is pretty good, [this shirt](https://imgur.com/MVr0bcx) is bad, and [this one](https://imgur.com/6UE21Gd) is the worst offender. I usually buy mens/vintage because they better fit my criteria.
* I don't really like brown to begin with but I hate brown/pink or brown/blue. I think this stems from those being popular color combos when I was in middle school.
* Any kind of jacket/cardigan/etc that I wear has to fall below the shirt I'm wearing.

What other details are important to you and ""make"" your outfit feel complete? Do you pay attention to these details when observing others?

For example, I have this thing with watches. Not only do I not mix metals (unless the watch itself is two-toned, but I wouldn't wear a gold watch and a silver ring, especially not on the same hand), but I also think the right size is important. If I'm wearing a more casual outfit, I'll wear a bigger watch (38mm), but if I'm wearing a more ""delicate"" lace top I always wear a smaller watch (either 24 or 33mm). If I'm wearing a black outfit, I will wear a watch with a black dial, never a white one, and if I'm wearing a light colored top (think white or pastels), I would a watch with a white dial (I don't have a watch with a silver or gold dial so I can't comment on that). Also I would never wear a bracelet on my watch-wrist. Not only would I be scared to scratch the metal or glass, but I also think it looks like ""accessory overkill"". 

Another detail i pay attention to is nail polish. If I'm wearing my gold watch, especially the one with the black dial, a cool-toned nude pink nail polish just looks so bad in my opinion.

For the sake of the argument, they can either be used as such or interchangeably, whatever you prefer, but please do specify!

Now, the thing I wanted to talk about is the concept of femininity in this modern age. From what I've noticed, back in the early 1900s, this used to be all about women looking soft, with round cheeks and little facial definition.

On the other hand, most women that are considered very attractive, beautiful or feminine nowadays seem to be about these women's opposite: very defined faces, often highlighted, and generally quite tight outfits. Jeans and tees have become pretty much the norm and are considered plenty feminine by most, whereas in the past, these would have been almost exclusively men's clothes.

So, what I was wondering is: how do you define *your* femininity in our modern society? Is being feminine/girly actually important to you? Do you feel feminine in jeans and a tee or are pretty dresses what makes your heart race? Very interested in hearing what you all have to say!

Unfortunately, all of my favorite patterns and styles come with bottoms whose cut are mere centimeters away from becoming a thong! To be honest, I do a lot of my shopping either online on amazon, or at forever 21 and h&amp;m (I am a broke college student), and I absolutely love fun prints but most of them have extremely revealing bottoms. For example I found [this](https://imgur.com/a/Nto0dfB) bikini on amazon and I am in LOVE with it, but I don't know if I am comfortable showing that much of my butt? And I can't seem to find a version with bottoms that have more full coverage.

4169,"I've done a few style boxes in the past, Stitch Fix and Trunk Club.  I don't really have trouble picking out my own clothes but I like having other people pick out stuff that I normally wouldn't even try on.  I saw that Material World started doing a ""consignment"" style box, (aka they send you used clothing) and wanted to try it out.

Website/Style Profile:  The style profile was actually quite detailed, which I liked.  You pick out what kind of cuts you like, what designers you wear and any fit issues you have.  It's pretty obvious that this is a new company though.  It's hard to edit your style profile once it's completed and the check out process could use some work.

Style preview:  They send you an email with 10 items, you can choose to accept 5 of them or have them send you something else completely.  It's pretty similar to Trunk Club in that way.   

What they actually picked: I'm a size 10/12. I dress ""edgy"", think Alexander McQueen, AllSaints and Rick Owens.  I don't wear blue jeans and I can't walk in a heel higher than 3"", this was all mentioned in the style profile.  I also showed them 3 different outfits I wear.   In the preview they picked two pairs of stilettos with 4"" heels and a bunch of random black clothing.  (I don't have a screenshot of what was in the style preview and I can't go back and look at it now).  I chose to have them send me a pair of Hugo Boss pants and a Elizabeth and James mesh dress.  

[This is what was sent](https://imgur.com/a/3VeNDwB)  Sorry for the crap photo but that's what they have on their site and I don't really feel like taking pictures of everything.   

The mesh dress ($104) does not have a lining/under-layer like shown, it's all just completely see through and it's a medium.  I can almost never wear a medium, especially not in designer clothes.  Suffice to say, it doesn't fit.

The next dress is by SUNO ($70), the tag is falling off but it's in otherwise okay condition, but it's not my style at all.  

The third thing just looks like a white blob but it's a White + Warren Sweater ($110).  This is insanely priced to me, I found new White + Warren sweaters for $80 and this is used.   Also, not my style. It has blouson sleeves and it looks pretty cheap for what's supposed to be a $200 sweater.   Also, it's spring, why are you sending me a sweater?  

Next is a Vince Blazer ($100).  I actually like this and I'll probably keep it.  

The Hugo Boss pants ($55) honestly feel like fakes, they just look like cheap polyester pants.  I have a Hugo Boss dress and it's beautifully tailored and made out of very nice fabric. They might've just been made for an outlet, I don't know.

Overall I feel like either the stylist didn't listen to me, or they didn't understand exactly what my style is or their selection is really limited (probably the latter).  The style fee is $29 which is reasonable.  I wasn't impressed with what I got though and probably won't use them in the future.     I tried a Material World ""consignment"" style box.",t5_2s8o5,fashion,"I've done a few style boxes in the past, Stitch Fix and Trunk Club.  I don't really have trouble picking out my own clothes but I like having other people pick out stuff that I normally wouldn't even try on.  I saw that Material World started doing a ""consignment"" style box, (aka they send you used clothing) and wanted to try it out.

Website/Style Profile:  The style profile was actually quite detailed, which I liked.  You pick out what kind of cuts you like, what designers you wear and any fit issues you have.  It's pretty obvious that this is a new company though.  It's hard to edit your style profile once it's completed and the check out process could use some work.

Style preview:  They send you an email with 10 items, you can choose to accept 5 of them or have them send you something else completely.  It's pretty similar to Trunk Club in that way.   

What they actually picked: I'm a size 10/12. I dress ""edgy"", think Alexander McQueen, AllSaints and Rick Owens.  I don't wear blue jeans and I can't walk in a heel higher than 3"", this was all mentioned in the style profile.  I also showed them 3 different outfits I wear.   In the preview they picked two pairs of stilettos with 4"" heels and a bunch of random black clothing.  (I don't have a screenshot of what was in the style preview and I can't go back and look at it now).  I chose to have them send me a pair of Hugo Boss pants and a Elizabeth and James mesh dress.  

[This is what was sent](https://imgur.com/a/3VeNDwB)  Sorry for the crap photo but that's what they have on their site and I don't really feel like taking pictures of everything.   

The mesh dress ($104) does not have a lining/under-layer like shown, it's all just completely see through and it's a medium.  I can almost never wear a medium, especially not in designer clothes.  Suffice to say, it doesn't fit.

The next dress is by SUNO ($70), the tag is falling off but it's in otherwise okay condition, but it's not my style at all.  

The third thing just looks like a white blob but it's a White + Warren Sweater ($110).  This is insanely priced to me, I found new White + Warren sweaters for $80 and this is used.   Also, not my style. It has blouson sleeves and it looks pretty cheap for what's supposed to be a $200 sweater.   Also, it's spring, why are you sending me a sweater?

**[Here is the tutorial](https://imgur.com/a/btscIIv)**

TLDR don't click anything that says ""publish"" or ""public"" or ""share to community"". Make all your uploads and albums have the ""Hidden"" privacy setting. Get the share link from the dropdown menu in imgur above photo and not from your browser's address bar.

I annotated screenshots showing how to

* upload your pictures to imgur using the mobile website
* create an album
* get the share link for your image or album so other people can see them from reddit

without accidentally submitting them to the imgur public gallery and then getting all sorts of creepy comments on them. If you are chill enough that you don't mind having your outfit photos shared to the general population of imgur, more power to you, but for anyone who wants a *little* more privacy, hopefully this is helpful.

Imgur is filled with many scummy users and frequently has overloaded severs, but it was created for the express purpose of hosting reddit images^[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imgur#History) and continues to be the standard for hosting. I wish I had the time and devices to show how this looks on different phones and browsers, but hopefully you can get the idea from this example.

Whether you host your image files on imgur or somewhere else, I am very much in favor of linking directly to images (not albums containing an image, not the link to the image within imgur, just the link where the URL ends in the image file extension like .jpg) on threads because it is the least disruptive way you can show someone a photo. They don't have to get redirected to another app or some website with five tons of javascript and ads and gifs that have to load. This is great for people on slower connections or older devices, as well as anyone using a browser extension such as the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) that lets them expand images in-thread.^(Thank you for coming to my TED talk.)

I carry with me on a daily basis: lunch, a fruit, 32oz water bottle, small coffee thermos, a small chromebook or tablet, some papers/notebook, small wallet, small umbrella, a pouch with other misc like sunglasses, eyedrops, mirror, etc. 

If I put all those things in one bag it’s way too heavy for the amount of walking I do (even if using a backpack).

4193,"Season 3 of Queer Eye is out now (yay!), and the first episode focuses on a woman who feels very feminine but doesn't know how to express that femininity in everyday life, especially since a lot of her wardrobe is hunting/athletic clothes. Over the course of the episode, she realizes that she loves having styled hair and some high heels once in a while. 

The episode also touches on what femininity even is (the consensus seems to be that there's a spectrum between femininity and masculinity that doesn't necessarily have to do with the gender you identify with) and how to feel beautiful (expressing yourself and putting in a bit of effort is feeling good). 

Inspired by that, I wanted to ask what the people of FFA feel confident and beautiful in. Personally, I love having my hair curled/wavy (I've found that putting my hair in two buns overnight and then using a 1 inch wand on just the top layer does a lot in just 5-10 minutes). I actually like most things that emphasize my hair (like a nice style or something) because it's one of the things about myself I like the best. And, I like wearing the jewelry given to me by my grandmothers because it's my heritage and history and makes me feel like I've got love behind me, if that makes sense.

I’m in my early/mid-20s and everything that I try on makes me feel like a frumpy grandma, from the patterns to the colors to the fit. I’m also at a total loss for shoes, I really don’t like wearing heels (or ballet flats, it rains a lot where I live, and I get extremely cold if any part of my feet are exposed, but I can deal with it if I have to).

I literally have no other clothes for work, I borrowed something for the interview. 

I have no sense of style since I have a very weird body shape, I try to hide it. I have always felt frumpy, even in jeans and T-shirt’s. Please please help me, I really don’t know what I’m doing when it comes to clothing and I’m so tired of looking like a clown in oversized and ripped up clothing because I can’t afford anything else.

My legs and torso are pretty equally sized. Basically, I look like a Picasso painting.  Plus I have curly hair that doesn’t cooperate, no matter how much I follow r/curlyhair and overly sensitive skin that can’t handle makeup (my eyes will literally get swollen shut if there’s any trace of it on overnight). 

Honestly I probably just need someone to kick me in the ass and tell me to get over all of these insecurities and then point me in the right direction to a Pinterest board or something.

4211,"Hi there! So, I had a popular and somewhat polarizing post a while back about how I machine wash pretty much everything and how you can too. I wanted to share some updated advice since I made my first post for anyone who is interested:

1. Eucalan is magic for wool and silk. I had quite a few commenters on my first post recommend using a detergent that was formulated for wool/delicates and I took that advice and ran with it. I purchased Eucalan Lavender No-Rinse Delicate Wash and I've been using it on my wool and silk items. It's made a huge difference in the look and feel of some of my clothes! It contains lanolin, and since you don't rinse it out it leaves the lanolin behind on the clothing. It's brought back that like-new sheen to my silk and made my wool items feel much softer. I still machine wash, I just watch the cycle and skip the rinse.

2. Dryer balls felt sweaters, even when they're in mesh bags. When I type it out, it seems so obvious. I don't use dryer sheets because I don't like the film they leave behind, and I'd read about how great wool dryer balls are for fluffing things up. I got a set of 3 dryer balls and was using them on my regular, non-delicate items with pretty good results. I wanted to fluff up a chunky knit 100% Merino wool sweater that was about 99% dry, so I put it in a mesh bag and put it in the dryer on air fluff with the dryer balls. The sweater isn't ruined, but there's a small section across the upper back that feels a bit tight and felted. It looks alright, and some stretching out while wet helped loosen things, but I wish I hadn't used dryer balls with it. Friction felts wool, and I should have known better. But, as I said in the last post and will say again: ""Don't wash anything you aren't prepared to lose!""

&amp;#x200B;

I've listed brands I'm familiar with below. Please add more in the comments! Any brand that regularly makes jeans is fair game, even if it's not a denim specialty brand.

&amp;#x200B;

[AGOLDE](https://www.agolde.com/)

*Size range:* 23-32

*Price range:* $128 (shorts) to $248 (full jumpsuit)  USD

*Niche:* Wide range of both vintage-inspired and contemporary styles. Mostly no stretch (100% cotton) or low stretch (98% cotton), though their are a few high stretch options.

*Notable styles:* The Jamie Hi Rise Classic, and the Nico Slim are great un-fussy versatile styles.

*Other Notes:* Sewn in Los Angeles.

&amp;#x200B;

[AG  Adriano Goldschmied](https://www.agjeans.com)

*Size range:* 22-32

*Price range:* Most styles are around $200  USD

*Niche:* High quality denim in really beautiful, intricate washes (seriously, I think AG washes are some of the most beautiful). Wide range of silhouettes (many variants of skinny and slim or straight leg jeans, but also flares, bootcuts, trouser jeans, boyfriend jeans, wide leg jeans...)

*Notable styles:* The Farrah High Rise Skinny is beloved by many who need a little extra room in the hip and thigh. 

*Other Notes:* Because the brand is so big, certain more popular styles are pretty easy to find on secondhand sites.

&amp;#x200B;

[Citizens of Humanity](https://www.citizensofhumanity.com/)

*Size range:* 23-32

*Price range:* Most jeans are in the $170-300 range  USD

*Niche:* Similar to AG. High quality denim, beautiful washes, wide range of styles, fabrics, etc.

*Notable styles:* The Rocket skinny is incredibly popular. They also have a ton of nice slim straight leg styles right now. 

*Other Notes:* Like with AG, because this is a larger brand you can often find them on sale or secondhand. They have a limited number of jeans in tall inseams.

&amp;#x200B;

[Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/collections/womens-jeans)

*Size range:* 23-33

*Price range:* Most of Everlane's jeans are around $70  USD

*Niche:* (Relatively) affordable basics, (supposedly) radical transparency. Everlane offers a few popular silhouettes (skinnies, slim straight jeans, boyfriend jeans, kick flares) in a few different versatile washes. Some, but not all styles have short/regular/tall inseam options.

*Notable styles:* 1) The Cheeky jean is tight in the waist/hips/butt but relaxed in the leg, similar to the Levi's Wedgie. 2) The Authentic Stretch fabric line is a really nice option for people who want denim that is stretchy and has good shape retention, but still feels like actual denim.

*Other Notes:* Early reviews of Everlane's denim were fairly poor, suggesting that the jeans had uniquely bad shape retention (i.e. they bagged and sagged like crazy after a day of wear). But this seems to have improved with later iterations of their denim, especially the Authentic Stretch line.

&amp;#x200B;

[Good American](https://www.goodamerican.com)

*Size range:* 00 - 24 (numeric sizing, with an extra size ""15"" that they added when they noticed customers having issues with how their pattern grading changed between sizes 14 and 16)

*Price range:* $150 - $190 USD

*Niche:* Ultra-stretchy denim designed to be very comfortable and have great shape retention. Skews trendy (though more basic options are available too).

*Notable styles:* The ""Good Waist"" and ""Good Legs"" skinnies are their bestsellers, and come in a million variations.

*Other Notes:* While the entire brand is intended to be fairly curve-friendly, the ""Good Curve"" line is particularly so.

&amp;#x200B;

[GRLFRND](http://www.grlfrnd-denim.com/)

*Size range:* 23-32

*Price range:* $148 (shorts) to $328 (paper bag moto pants)  USD

*Niche:* Vintage-inspired, mostly 100% cotton denim. Many heavily distressed options.

*Notable styles:* The Karolina skinny and Helena straight.

*Other Notes:* I believe the company is either owned by or was formed in partnership with Revolve, but some other department stores sell them as well.

&amp;#x200B;

[Levi's](https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/shop/women)

*Size range:* 23-34 straight sizes and 16-24 (numeric) for plus sizes

*Price range: $*50-$230  USD

*Niche:* Levi's is a denim powerhouse. Though complaints about their quality control have grown louder over the years, they're still often one of the best bangs for your buck in terms of quality, especially on sale. Tons of variety in cuts, washes, rises, inseams, and fabrics.

*Notable styles:* 1) The classic 503 jeans, 2) the ""Wedgie"" fit, 3) the ""Mile High"" skinny

*Other Notes:* Many styles can easily be found secondhand, or at deep discounts.

&amp;#x200B;

Madewell

*Size range:* 23-37

*Price range:* $75-$135 USD

*Niche:* They carry a handful of on-trend silhouettes, both in more basic and more adventurous washes/styles. Mixture of super stretchy (e.g. Roadtrippers) and 100% cotton (e.g. the ""Perfect Summer"" slim straight leg jean), plus everything in between.

*Notable styles:* Their high rise curvy skinny jeans have taken the world by storm.

*Other Notes:* You can get a $20 discount off full price jeans by bringing an old pair with you for recycling. Most styles have short, regular, and taller options, some also have ""taller"" options.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mott &amp; Bow](https://www.mottandbow.com)

*Size range:* 24-40

*Price range:* Around $100  USD

*Niche:* No frills, quality basics. A few variants on the skinny jean (including a curvy cut), plus boyfriend jeans and mom jeans.

*Notable styles:* 1) [Classic black high rise skinny](https://www.mottandbow.com/women/best-sellers/high-rise-skinny-bond-rinse.html), 2) [Light wash mom jean](https://www.mottandbow.com/women/best-sellers/the-mom-jean-benson-light-blue.html)

*Other Notes: ""*Home Try On Program"" where they send you multiple sizes but you only get charged for the one you keep.

&amp;#x200B;

[Re/Done](https://shopredone.com/)

*Size range:* 23-32

*Price range: $83 to $350+*  USD

*Niche:* Lots of re-purposed vintage denim (like, they literally take old jeans apart and put them back together again, sometimes using multiple pairs to form one new pair), plus jeans that I think are just vintage-inspired.

*Notable styles:* The High Rise Stovepipe jeans

*Other Notes:* Review of their Levi's collab [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9xzjp8/update_review_of_redone_levis_jeans/) by u/[batrabies](https://www.reddit.com/user/batrabies)

&amp;#x200B;

[Warp &amp; Weft](https://www.warpweftworld.com/)

*Size range:* 00-24 (numeric sizes)

*Price range:* $80-$100 USD

*Niche: (*Relatively) affordable denim in on-trend cuts.

*Notable styles:* 1) The JFK skinny 2) A bunch of really stunning wide-leg fits.

*Other Notes:* PSA for those of you who complain about skinny jean pockets - the JFK skinny, at least in the two washes I tried, have very substantial front pockets.

* I only picked outfits that are wearable day-to-day. 
* I included one skirt and one dress. I don't believe that androgynous fashion = pants only. I think dresses/skirts are a fun way to play with balancing the fem/masc elements of an outfit. You'll notice that both outfits are dressed down with more masculine elements - the skirt is paired with an oversized button-up shirt, the dress is paired with an oversized denim jacket, and they're both paired with Docs.

I am the only female in my office, however I don't think that matters much as I know other women in the industry who wear a hoodie, jeans and sneakers daily and are fine with that.

But... I like to dress up! I adore a business casual wardrobe and have been coveting extrapetite's style (think skirt with tights, blouse and blazer, heels). I truly am confident and do not care about what people think, but I do feel like I look as though I'm very overdone if I show up to work like that, as compared to my coworkers I might as well be wearing a floor length gown.

What do you ladies do in these situations? Tone it down, or wear whatever you want? I've always been told dress for the job you want not the one you have... But even my higher ups wear jeans and a t-shirt/sweatshirt!! What's a J.Crew/Banana Republic girl to do?!",Discussion on SUPER casual work places,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/av0nv9/discussion_on_super_casual_work_places/
4236,"I was at Goodwill a few days ago and I saw a very chic mature woman. She was wearing these amazing voluminous jacquard pants and the prettiest bejeweled satin slippers. She sort of gave me Iris Apfel vibes with the cropped silver hair and was even wearing thick black rimmed circular glasses. Naturally, I approached her and told her I loved her entire outfit and asked if I could take a photo for reference. She agreed. Minutes later she taps me on the shoulder and asks “Are you shopping for spring?” When I said yes, she handed me a bright pink and white polka dot set and said “I was going to buy this for my daughter but she doesn’t want it, I hope you get it though since it’s so cute”. I jokingly asked her if she was a fashion stylist and she just smiled and said she didn’t think she’d be good at it but she would like to be. She then hands me a top off the rack and points to a skirt “These two would also go well together”. So I take them both and thank her and go to the fitting room to try them on. About 10 minutes later mid-change, someone knocks on my
door and a voice asks “Are you in there?” I open it and of course it’s the same lady. She puts a plaid jacket and a sweater in my hands and walks away, then comes right back and sticks a pair of pants under my changing room door. Unfortunately, she left before I could thank her again or show her what I ended up buying. 

I usually gravitate towards black and solid fabrics but I actually ended up loving a lot of the items even though they were all colorful or patterned. I didn’t buy everything but I was definitely inspired to be more creative with print mixing. 

I took some pictures of the outfits she chose for me. (Not pictured but I also ended up buying the bright pink polka dot skirt set.)

*Spoken with a thick southern accent in my recollection

""funny story...I've heard a few people's 'engineering in Australia' stories but I gotta good one... we were recently down in Victoria at an event to mark the handing over a surveillance UAV capability to the Australian intelligence community at the end of an acquisition process. This capability consistent in part of UAV air frame that looked like a bird from a distance. there were high-ranking officials from the Australian and us defence intelligence and counterterrorism communities all standing out in a beautiful meadow I think Australians call them paddocks and after a speech discussing the process and the capabilities of the system the crowd was directed to look skyward and to see the system in operation above the the paddock.

 At this point tlmy chief engineer for the project was invited to speak on how the capability was localised for the Australian environment and after a fairly long discussion of an intense process by which modifications were made to the capability to account for the vicissitudes of the Australian environment the engineer said quite confidently that yes they had engineered this thing to continue to function in the face of anything that the Australian environment could throw at it.

of course it this point and Australian wedge-tailed eagle with a 2 metre wingspan slammed into the top of the UAV clutching the control surfaces on one of its wings with its Claus and ferociously attacking the airframe it's beak. the engineers hand holding the microphone slowly dropped away from his mouth suicide as he like all the other spectators watched aghast as the feathered beast continue to attack the machine as it entered a flat spin and begin to plummet towards the Earth shedding pieces of control surface as it came. You could have heard a pin drop as the crowd in silence watch the flurry of feathers and steel racing towards the Earth. of course at the last moment the eagle's wings spread and it's at casually on a thermal to watch the last moments of the machine. 

A distant and narrow column of smoke marked the impact point nearby, as some pieces fell to earth amongst the crowd.""

The vast majority of wind turbines we see in the United States are supported by steel towers, with hub height (the elevation of the rotor axis) which typically do not exceed 90 m. The main reason for the height limitation is that the base of the steel tower cannot exceed 4.5m in diameter due to transportation limitations.  Higher towers produce bigger moments at the base and demand larger base diameters.  Alternatively, one can increase the wall thickness, but this is not very effective.

Going higher has advantages such as: 1) Catching stronger and most consistent winds, and 2) Allows the use of larger rotor blades, which enables the use of higher power turbines. One of the successful approaches to address this issue is the use of precast, post-tensioned concrete sections. The precasting can occur on-site, which eliminates, to a big extent, transportation issues and allows much larger diameters of the sections.

The tower you see here is based on technology developed in the United States by Wind Tower Technologies (WTT) in Boulder CO. Its first implementation, as a prototype, was in Iowa where a single 115m tall tower was constructed in a wind farm where all other towers were made of steel and were 80m tall ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXN1UAv1anQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXN1UAv1anQ)). 

It is currently implemented extensively in China by a Joint Venture (JV) of WTT and Golden Ocean.  The tower in the video is 130m (426.5 ft) tall. The bottom sections have an outer diameter of 7m.  The next set of sections have an outer diameter of 5.5m, and the upper sections have an outer diameter of 4m.  Transitional conical sections are used in between to go from one diameter to the next.  This allows the reduction of the required number of forms (6) while maintaining the very efficient circular tube geometry. The sections are then post-tensioned with a force of approximately 36000 kN (3674 metric tonnes, or 8100 kips).  The rotor blade tips form a rotational diameter of 121m and the power generator is rated at 2.1MW.  140m tall towers with a 3.1MW turbine are currently under design.

4537,"*For readers unfamiliar, photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique that assesses changes in blood pressure by measuring the intensity of light reflected from a target volume of tissue over time. Analysis of this signal can yield information about blood oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure, and local hemodynamic phenomena (such as vasoconstriction and vasodilation).* 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm designing a robot that requires physiological measurements of sexual arousal as feedback for a control loop. While there are several measurement techniques that can accomplish this (genital fMRI, FLIR thermography, etc), PPG (especially clitoral) is well established in medical literature as being accurate, repeatable, and highly correlated with self-reported arousal at a minimum of cost and complexity.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my application faces two crucial limitations:

1. The robot surfaces in contact with tissue targeted for measurement will be highly mobile, including intense vibration up to 200Hz. This will invariably have a deleterious effect on signal quality, and renders the use of every purpose-made PPG sensor I've found completely implausible.
2. The user may move relative to the robot. Without direct motion tracking of the target tissue, this will be effectively impossible to adequately compensate for.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the optical mouse sensor in question, the PixArt PMW3389DM. This sensor has the following relevant specifications:

* Accurate surface tracking up to 400 inches per second w/ acceleration up to \~500m/s^(2) \- faster than the maximum velocity and acceleration of the robot's surfaces
* 36x36 8-bit optical sensor array - suitable for imaging PPG according to literature
* 850nm LED - suitable for PPG
* Maximum frame capture rate of 12,000fps (software adjustable) - much higher than needed for any sort of PPG, and much higher than the Nyquist frequency of any component of robot motion
* 1Mbps SPI data output w/ a 'frame dump' option at a maximum of 50Hz - higher than needed for imaging PPG

&amp;#x200B;

*Note: laser mouse sensors have been used for PPG in literature (measuring shifts in speckle pattern to assess tissue deformation), but no optical mouse sensors have been used for this purpose as far as I can tell.*

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to do the following:

1. Fix a sensor on the anterior wall of the vaginal probe at a depth of \~50mm, and a second directly over the clitoris.
2. Use the high-speed motion tracking from both sensors (coupled with known motor position/velocity) to dynamically calculate an empirically validated vibration waveform inclusive of user motion.
3. Synchronize phase and frequency of sensor 'frame dumps' to this waveform, such that frames are captured when the sensor in question is at the same position/velocity relative to the user. This serves to mitigate both of the measurement limitations mentioned above.
4. Compute relevant physiological parameters from raw PPG image data.
5. Compute sexual arousal quantification from physiological parameters using a regression model (largely from literature).
6. Feed all results (including raw data and user motion data, as well as data from other sensor subsystems) into a regression model to quantitatively assess subjective sexual pleasure, as trained by manual user input.
7. Feed computed user pleasure assessment into the loss function of a machine learning algorithm responsible for controlling the robot, thereby enabling it to optimize for subjective pleasure.

&amp;#x200B;

If this design functions as I expect, it should allow the robot to learn optimal stimulation patterns for a particular user, and adjust them continuously as the user's body responds.

&amp;#x200B;

As this has (to the best of my knowledge) never been attempted before, I thought I'd post my plan here to ask for feedback. In particular, I'm most interested in the following:  
1. Did I overlook any obvious problems or design considerations?  
2. Are you aware of a better sensor for this purpose?  
3. Are you aware of a better hemodynamic measurement technique for this purpose?  
4. Is there a better (or more specialized) sub for me to ask this in?

6. Feed all results (including raw data and user motion data, as well as data from other sensor subsystems) into a regression model to quantitatively assess subjective sexual pleasure, as trained by manual user input.
7. Feed computed user pleasure assessment into the loss function of a machine learning algorithm responsible for controlling the robot, thereby enabling it to optimize for subjective pleasure.

&amp;#x200B;

If this design functions as I expect, it should allow the robot to learn optimal stimulation patterns for a particular user, and adjust them continuously as the user's body responds.

&amp;#x200B;

As this has (to the best of my knowledge) never been attempted before, I thought I'd post my plan here to ask for feedback. In particular, I'm most interested in the following:  
1. Did I overlook any obvious problems or design considerations?  
2. Are you aware of a better sensor for this purpose?  
3. Are you aware of a better hemodynamic measurement technique for this purpose?  
4. Is there a better (or more specialized) sub for me to ask this in?",Optical gaming mouse sensors for IR image-based vaginal/clitoral photoplethysmography?,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/bm264d/optical_gaming_mouse_sensors_for_ir_imagebased/

Another guy was asking me about whole house surge surpressors and was going to hire an electrician to install it. It literally just snaps into your breaker panel and you connect 2 wires to the neutral bus. I almost offered to just do it for him, because I can't imagine paying someone for that.

Obviously I didn't learn electrical or how to be a mechanic in school, but my degree gave me the background and understanding that I need to be able to figure it out, or if I can't, I can do some research (youtube) and find out how to fix it.

I've been working with other engineering sub reddits this past week to help me better understand what symbols could represent their whole field. I'm now coming to the r/engineering mothership for suggestions on what fields I'm missing. For this project I'm looking to make between 10-12 unique notebooks that represent major branches within the field of engineering. The series of notebooks is constrained in 3 ways: page size (8.5x11"") , Binding (hardcover sewn layflat), and inside paper type (engineering grid - [https://imgur.com/vlYs7dt](https://imgur.com/vlYs7dt)). So I'm looking for fields that, a) use notebooks, and b) use engineering grid. In subsequent product launches we can explore other options, but for now these are the project constraints.  

**Here is a list of the current notebooks in the series:**

The glasses don't look like they can even be used inside a plant unless they sport the same safety ratings than safety glasses (I would be so happy to be wrong about this but I think MS would have mentionned it).

The Army apprently bought hundreds of thousands of these devices but I'm really interested in the industrial setting. The glasses don't look like they can even be used inside a plant unless they sport the same safety ratings than safety glasses (I would be so happy to be wrong about this but I think MS would have mentionned it).

**Scalars, Vectors, and Tensors** are the heart of machine learning. Tensors lend themselves quite well to data representation; for example, a picture might be represented as a tensor of order three where each pixel has corresponding R, G, B values. It's extremely important to have a basic understanding of [what tensors represent and how to manipulate them using linear algebra techniques](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-vectors). 

**ℝ^n spaces and higher-dimensional space.** One of the hardest parts of Machine Learning for me was [visualizing data in dimensions past n=three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSUMBkrqLdY). Because we ""vectorize"" our complicated data, it often exists in a large multidimensional space. It's important to understand higher dimensional spaces, and that we are not limited to three dimensions despite how we see and visualize real space.

**Partial derivatives and gradients** are used for activation functions and a variety of optimization functions. We often use the inverse [gradient](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/GradientVectorTangentPlane.aspx) of a function to determine how weights are adjusted to minimize error. To perform gradient calculations, you will need to know how to [take partial derivatives of a function](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/PartialDerivatives.aspx).

**Regression** is used to find lines of fit for data and determine how great an effect each point has on a final outcome. A brief explanation of regression can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-types-of-regression-and-their-properties-c5e1fa12d55e).

**NumPy** is a mathematics tool for Python. It contains simple calls for complex mathematical operations, such as finding the gradient of a surface, multiplying vectors, or taking the average of multiple data. NumPy has incredible [documentation](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/index.html).

**Pandas** allows for data to be read into python. We often work with .csv files and Pandas is the ""translator"" that allows us to read them in. [This](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-introduction-to-the-pandas-python-library-f1b678f34673) is the most intuitive explanation of Pandas I have yet found. It is very powerful and relatively straightforward.

**MatPlotLib** allows data to be presented with charts and plots. This is essential for communicating the results of your algorithm. [Their website](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) has a very helpful list of tutorials.

**Seaborn** is an extension of MatPlotLib with fantastic tools such as a correlation heatmap. [Their website](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) also has decent documentation.

**TENSORFLOW AND KERAS** are a fantastic, comprehensive ML library built by Google. Many of the standard ML libraries are built straight into TF, eliminating the need to write tedious mathematical processes. Because it is such a popular and well-used library, their website has [fantastic documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras)

Hi everyone, I'm trying to put some basic beginner python skills to use with a productive project for something I'd need for work that I think I could automate and improve over time. There probably is something already existing out there, some app of sorts, but since this is a learning experience I'd like to be able to build it step by step even if it takes me a year. Understanding the whole process would benefit me more than downloading and learning an already existing app. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing out the idea as I have it now and kindly asking for any direction as to how to best go about this both from a descriptive/planning point of view as well as a script structure kind.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose I'd have to start somewhere REALLY basic and work my way up, but at least having a clear idea of what I want to eventually achieve would help as a guide to determine what exactly I should be practising/learning.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind all my knowledge comes from 'How to automate the boring stuff' and basic programming courses in C taken back in college.

&amp;#x200B;

I think in general the approach I should take would be to define the use cases as much as possible, basically be as detailed as possible as to what I'd expect the script/program to do, and then work on how to achieve that.

the end of it. The simple and very basic GUI should have also checkboxes for 'holiday', 'PTO', and 'WFH' (working from home), etc., some of which would gray out the timers and set default values for that. The data would be stored and reports in different kinds of formats need be generated.

Not sure if you guys remember me. But, 6 months ago, I wrote a post here -- talking about my success story of becoming a programmer from a chemist:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9umxty/been\_a\_chemist\_for\_9\_years\_with\_2\_degrees\_decided/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9umxty/been_a_chemist_for_9_years_with_2_degrees_decided/)

&amp;#x200B;

I got like \~2k upvotes. I remember doing my best to interact with 200+ comments and DMs (in fact, I don't think I missed a single one). I was super excited to help because I know what's it like to be on the other side -- learning how to program, hopefully, good enough to get a job, etc. And reading all the responses got me inspired to create a programming YouTube channel, so I could help others on my own platform.

&amp;#x200B;

The first channel didn't do so well. Mainly because I didn't have time to upload frequently. So, I rebranded recently, and I've been passively making programming related videos. Just a few days ago, I thought ""yeah, maybe I should make &amp; upload a video version of the post I wrote on Reddit."" So, I did that and 3 days later... this happened.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just like another Friday morning. I was making jokes with co-workers. I think I was a bit excited about the company-provided free lunch. Then, the management called me into the office. First thing I thought, ""Maybe they call me in to talk about the website I built some weeks ago. They liked it, so that must be it""

&amp;#x200B;

I got laid off.

&amp;#x200B;

\[ Now, let me be absolutely clear. I'm not here to rant about the situation. I have the utmost respect for the organization and the people I worked with. I understand their decision 100% (although I'm not 100% sure what it is). I'm just here to express the irony of all this. One day you are talking about how to go from 16k to 85k salary. The next day you are back to making $0. \]

&amp;#x200B;

I think I spend a good two-days trying to figure out what I did wrong.

* Was it because of what I did/said?
* Was it because I didn't deliver XYZ in time?
* Was it because I managed my hours poorly?
* Was it because...?

I don't know. All I know is that I did something not-so-cool that the management didn't like-so-much. And it's all in the past. There's nothing I can do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I failed about 7 times before becoming a programmer (med school, actuarial exams, Ph.D. program, etc.). So, it really wasn't that hard accepting the 8th failure. In fact, it was a lot easier than telling my wife on Friday afternoon. Every time I hit a rock bottom, I like to remind myself that life is not just about living the prime moments. It's about riding the waves of ups and downs. So, now that I have the downshift momentum, how am I going to ride this wave upwards?

&amp;#x200B;

I think there are 3 ways I can achieve the greatest comeback:

1. Get a job that's better than what I had before.
2. Build side projects and turn them into profitable startups - Inspired by Pieter Levels' 12 startups in 12 months project ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6reLWfFNer0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6reLWfFNer0))
3. Document everything on my YouTube channel - Programming vlog?.

Realistically speaking, No. 1 should be the most reasonable goal. But, I've always been a fan of No. 2 and 3. When you are at the verge of a complete failure, you have enough courage to do something crazy. Sometimes, it's the fear of lows that make you rise to the top (fan of The Dark Knight Rises anyone?) Anyways, my plan is to do all 3 simultaneously and see which one takes off.

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's my story. I think I'm the first one here to write both the success and the failure story.

1. Get a job that's better than what I had before.
2. Build side projects and turn them into profitable startups - Inspired by Pieter Levels' 12 startups in 12 months project ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6reLWfFNer0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6reLWfFNer0))
3. Document everything on my YouTube channel - Programming vlog?.

Realistically speaking, No. 1 should be the most reasonable goal. But, I've always been a fan of No. 2 and 3. When you are at the verge of a complete failure, you have enough courage to do something crazy. Sometimes, it's the fear of lows that make you rise to the top (fan of The Dark Knight Rises anyone?) Anyways, my plan is to do all 3 simultaneously and see which one takes off.

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's my story. I think I'm the first one here to write both the success and the failure story.

I'm noticing though that many of these supposedly ""beginner"" level issues are actually very advanced/senior level issues that would cause most beginners to just quit.

For example, I came across a project working on a mail client and the project leader posted a beginner issue about a GUI button not working properly and that they needed it re-written similar to the other working buttons in the code. Sounds simple enough, right?

Well, a newbie came along and stated he'd like to take a look and asked for more input about the ""issue"" since the leader's post was vague. The response?

Project Leader: Hi, you'll need to know Python, C, Javascript, CSS, HTML, about 5 frameworks, 4 APIs, 3 GUI programs, we only use these few deprecated libraries, we only use this obscure IDE, you'll need to test it in 3 different environments and then send it for testing to two different servers. Plus, once done, please update our README files, add a doc about the buttons, and also re-write our HTML and CSS files in accordance with the button fix.

Then, the project leader writes: Oh and sorry about all the spaghetti code tehe

It gets better though...I decided to have a look at the files myself and within the code itself, the contributors have a ton of lines hashed out with statements like ""Oh, someone please fix this too cause I doubt it actually works for the clients.""

I've seen cases where someone has been coding for less than a year and they are, frankly, more skilled and more knowledgeable than someone who has been doing it for five.

The second is simple: the individual does everything related to coding that doesn't involve writing code. They attend every meetup. They share relevant content on LI daily. They're subscribed to every subreddit. But they're never actually creating anything. Zero green squares on GitHub.

I have a very strong background in mathematics, so I don’t have issues with abstract thinking, problem solving, or coming up with clever (but not too clever) solutions. I’m also pretty good at reading and understanding technical jargon, and some of the resources in the FAQ (and Google) have been very helpful in my learning. My goal is to eventually get a full-time programming job, and I feel like I'm making good progress toward that goal.

That being said, I would like to start paying attention to some of the other skills a good programmer should have. How do I organize and format my code? How do I write good code and avoid writing bad code? Why is version control important, and how do I best implement it into my projects? What are the best practices on commenting code? How should I use GitHub to store and share my code? Is there anything else important to consider that I've just never heard of?

I know a lot of these questions are cultural or language specific, but I'm looking for more of an overview on these topics. I also know that once I get a job programming, I'll probably be able to pick up all these skills pretty quickly, but I'm not working with anyone else right now, and I want to make sure that when I do start working with other people, the beginnings of these skills are already in place.

What are some good articles, essays, blog posts, books, videos, podcasts, or anything else that might help me with these kinds of concepts? I'm sure I can (and probably will) Google around for resources, but recommendations from a human are always better than search engine results. 

I'm primarily using python right now, but I occasionally use C++ and Swift.

4618,"Had a noteworthy event a while back I thought many people in here would get a kick out of. This was originally posted in the python reddit, but it was suggested I repost it here, so here it is. I work as the IT tutor at my school and has part of that I  handle any Intro to Programming appointments that we get. The class isn't really intended to teach you how to program in a given language, though it does use python, but rather to introduce you to the basic programming concepts of variables, data types, loops, functions, classes, etc.

So I had a student come in, basically at her wit's end, border-line in tears. Short of the long: 5 weeks into class and she was not understanding the concepts and it was really frustrating her. Okay, so I hunker down and start working with her. In this case, focusing on loops (as that's chapter 6 in the book). He seems to kind of, sort of be getting it, if I hold her hand and lead her through it.

30 minutes in and we haven't really made any progress. I took a step back and started working with her on comparison operations. But she wasn't really getting that either. she is getting more frustrated. So I try to get her mind off the material for a moment.  Her phone flashes a reminder about ""D&amp;D party"" tonight. So I ask if she plays D&amp;D. She does, and we chat briefly about the campaign she's in (she plays a rogue, go figure). Then I hit on an idea.

""You know a lot of early programmers were RPG players and because of  that a lot of what developed into modern programming was influenced and  based on RPG mechanics?""

She looked at me like I'm making a really bad setup for an even worse joke.

""I'm serious. How do you determine if you pass or fail a stat-test?"" I ask.

 ""Well, you determine what you need to roll over to pass, roll a dice,  add any modifiers you have and compare that to the first number."" She explains, more energetically.

""So you perform a comparison operation?"" I asked leadingly.

 ""Well... no. I mean...  kind of... wait..."" She stammers out, her response was interspersed as she thought and talked at the same time. 

I go to write on the White board: 


    if Dice_roll+modifiers &gt;= needed-roll:  
        you pass  
     else:  
         you fail

She looked at it for a long moment, you could see the gears turning in her head. 

 ""So the variable, Dice_Roll is added to the variable modifiers.. and that's compared to the needed roll. If the needed_roll is higher... you  fail... otherwise... you pass."" She parses out, once more thinking and speaking at the same time.

""Yeah... and what about this one?"" I ask as I write on the board:

     while enemy_attack == True:            
          player.cast(shield)

She looks at it for a minute. 

""So long as the enemy is attacking, cast the shield spell."" she says.

""Nice, how about this one?"" 

     for each enemy in hoard:  
          If player.hp &gt; enemy.defense:  
               Target_enemy = True   
               while Target_enemy == True:  
                    player.attack(sword,enemy)

 ""For each enemy in the hoard... check to see if the player Hit Points are greater then the that enemy's defense. If it is, target that enemy.  As long as that enemy is targeted, attack them.""

""And you just worked through a while loop nested inside an if control statement that was inside a while loop."" I explain.

 ""What?"" She says aghast. She quickly turns back to the board and starts studying the examples intently. I can see her eyes traveling across what I wrote.

""So this on is just a comparison operator?"" She asks pointing to the dice roll I wrote out before.

""Yup."" I respond.

 ""And this is just a while loop that would tell the player character to  cast the shield spell.""  She asks sounding more confident.

""Yup."" I respond.

 Her entire face lights up in that unmistakable look of 'the light bulb turning on'. We start hammering through more examples of loops and control statements, fluctuating between the requirements of her assignments and using RPG examples. It's a fun day when you get to talk about Dragons and knights and actually have it be work related.

I had been a passionate skateboarder at that time but I had no serious plans of my own - basically, I did not know what to do with my life.

Programming has changed that for me, dramatically.

All of a sudden I had a ton of stuff I wanted to try - be it frameworks, best practices, libraries, side projects, you name it. I had so many ideas and so little time. After 2 years of trying a whole ton of stuff I ended up with one of the best jobs you could get as a fresh software engineer - I had become a senior dev at Deutsche Bank. I had a great salary, a ton of time to chat with friends during office hours and nobody knew what I was doing, I felt like a wizard in this old, shady corporation.

During this time I used to talk about coding with my friends, send them courses (Freecodecamp!) and code snippets. I have fixed their code via messenger more than a couple of times.

That’s when I noticed that learning programming on mobile is hard. Like, really hard. You could not find a nice way of doing it, all you could do is learn theory unless you were really, really determined.

I decided to try coding something like Freecodecamp but for mobile devices.

Once I started working on the thing I noticed something - I could no longer focus on my job. All I wanted to do was to make a cool learning app that you could use in metro, uni or a plane. I invited my friends who were very new to programming but had that grit to join.

And we made this: [codengo.net](https://codengo.net)

It’s the first app of it’s kind so we had a lot to figure out:

Will it even work for mobile browsers?

How do you make a good programming keyboard and fit all the important keys there?

How do you make the app not laggy?

How do you deal with insane keyboard bugs? - Gboard and Swift keyboards do not put letters into text fields initially. Instead, all the words in progress are just suggestions. This is fine for anything but coding - if you try to add programming keys on top of the keyboard and make the code not disappear when typing you need to do some game development level hacks.

How do you support offline coding?

Why would mobile safari devs mess up closures (yeah, go figure!)?

What is Samsung browser anyway?

4625,"First off, apologies in advance for the brag/humble brag/“mom look at me” post—I’m just so happy and I want to tell someone (other than my inner circle of friends/family). For me personally, I’ve always enjoyed the encouraging/inspirational posts from other “outsiders” like me who broke into tech, the reminders that all the hard work, countless hours spent learning, internalizing, building, can actually lead somewhere—and now I get to properly make one of my own. 

Last week, after a rigorous process of vetting and interviewing, I accepted an offer from a VC funded startup in my city as a frontend developer. I’ll be part of a small team, focused primarily on UI/UX. The product is exciting, the stack (React frontend) is awesome, the design is great, and the team is friendly, sharp, and welcoming. And of course the meat of the issue; the compensation is better than I anticipated considering this is my first “official” position as a developer. 100k base, 10% performance based annual bonus, and a generous equity package. I’m as happy as a kid on Christmas.

It’s worth noting that while this *is* my first salaried developer job, It’s far from the beginning of my career—I’ve got a decade of experience as a manager and leader at various startups and small businesses so this is a career *change* for me, not the start of my career. I’ve also been moonlighting and freelancing for quite a while, building websites for small businesses, designing logos and branding packages, consulting in areas where my domain knowledge overlap with the technology, and that played a very large role in my getting such a good offer off the bat. Nonetheless, it’s still uncharted territory for me, and it feels like a major validation getting hired properly, and I’m pumped.

So what’s the point, other than the shameless bragging? 

The point is: A. Yes, you can teach yourself to code and get a six figure salary. I started putting my resume out there on LinkedIn and Angel.co about 6 weeks ago and the response was phenomenal. I had about a dozen phone interviews within the first couple weeks, made it past the technical interview with four of them, and had to cancel the other three final interviews before the offer stage when I accepted the position I did. The market is hungry, and if you’ve got the chops, the jobs are certainly there.

As far as I can tell, the most important thing you can do is just *keep on building things*. Build websites, build apps, start little micro businesses and Indie hacker type projects, deploy across a range of services and techniques (I have Digitalocean droplets, cPanel sites, Netlify sites, Github pages, etc) and try to push code to Github as close to daily as possible. Try to create projects that accurately reflect what it’s like to work in production level environments. Use fullstack solutions, contribute to big open source code bases, work with starter projects like Vulcan and Apollo Universal to get a feel for what projects at scale really look like. Constantly dig through big well designed codebases, read them, copy them, break them, modify them, whatever you have to do to grok them. Learn best practices, work with all the technologies, use your command line!! (I like iTerm and ZSH with a bunch of cool scripts and addons) Fake it til you make it—in the good way! If you keep working on projects that reflect the realities of the businesses you’re interested in working at, you will eventually be qualified to work at them by proxy. If you’re determined, and persistent, you can get where you want to go.

And one more thing—it may be cliche but I think it’s important for a lot of people to hear. It’s really never too late. If you’re worried that you’re “too old” to get into programming, don’t be. It’s a total myth (in my experience) that age is a limiting factor. Smart companies recognize that soft skills and a wealth of experience in the real world are invaluable. If you’re smart and optimistic, you can always learn the next technology, but the only way to get experience is to live it. 

Thanks for reading, I’m pumped for what comes next. I did, and so can you!!!   Another self taught success story! --I just landed my first +100k salary position as a developer!",t5_2r7yd,science and tech,"First off, apologies in advance for the brag/humble brag/“mom look at me” post—I’m just so happy and I want to tell someone (other than my inner circle of friends/family). For me personally, I’ve always enjoyed the encouraging/inspirational posts from other “outsiders” like me who broke into tech, the reminders that all the hard work, countless hours spent learning, internalizing, building, can actually lead somewhere—and now I get to properly make one of my own. 

Last week, after a rigorous process of vetting and interviewing, I accepted an offer from a VC funded startup in my city as a frontend developer. I’ll be part of a small team, focused primarily on UI/UX. The product is exciting, the stack (React frontend) is awesome, the design is great, and the team is friendly, sharp, and welcoming. And of course the meat of the issue; the compensation is better than I anticipated considering this is my first “official” position as a developer. 100k base, 10% performance based annual bonus, and a generous equity package. I’m as happy as a kid on Christmas.

It’s worth noting that while this *is* my first salaried developer job, It’s far from the beginning of my career—I’ve got a decade of experience as a manager and leader at various startups and small businesses so this is a career *change* for me, not the start of my career. I’ve also been moonlighting and freelancing for quite a while, building websites for small businesses, designing logos and branding packages, consulting in areas where my domain knowledge overlap with the technology, and that played a very large role in my getting such a good offer off the bat. Nonetheless, it’s still uncharted territory for me, and it feels like a major validation getting hired properly, and I’m pumped.

4628,"You don't need a degree in CS to be employed as a programmer. 

Though if that's the option you're looking at and you have yet to decide on a school, here's *a ruthlessly practical* and _highly_ opinionated guide to picking a good Computer Science program. It acts as a checklist for students who know they want to go into computer science and have no one to guide them through the process.

It does not cover:

- The cost of a university.
- The quality of the professors.
- The US News ""rank"" of the university.

Some amazing universities are dirt cheap compared to your local private school. Some places have great professors, but you may end up lacking career opportunities. US News rank means nothing and is likely manipulated.

Instead, this guide focuses on specific qualities that you can easily Google.

## TL;DR: Checklist

- Does the university protect you against **exploding offers?**
- Does the school have **regular career fairs** with tech companies attending?
- Does the university have **course offerings for interviews?**
- Does the school have ""dorm room"" **investment opportunities**? (Contrary Capital, DormroomFund, roughdraft.vc, school sponsored).
- Does the school have access to **hackathons?**
- Does the school have access to a **tech hub?**

## Does the university protect you against exploding offers?

An exploding offer is an offer from an employer that forces you to decide _extremely_ quickly otherwise it's rescinded. Like, make up your mind by the end of the day.

Exploding offers are a manipulative tactic that's typically used by companies who are struggling to attract talent.

Universities that have legitimate career opportunities for Computer Science and Computer Engineering grads have policies against exploding offers. If a company gives a student an exploding offer, they can report it to the university and the company is banned from recruiting.

If a university _doesn't_ have a policy, **it's a good sign they're struggling to bring job offers to the school.** If you see this, bail.

It's not hugely important for a university to protect you against exploding offers, you can always turn them down. But it's a good litmus test for a school that has _pull_ with companies and one that does not.

### How to find out

Try the following search queries in Google:

```
{COLLEGE I WANT} exploding offer
{COLLEGE I WANT} offer guidelines
{COLLEGE I WANT} employer guidelines
{COLLEGE I WANT} internship guidelines
```

If they have nothing available, copy/paste this email and send it to their career center:

```
Hi!

I'm a prospective student doing research on your university.
I was wondering if you have any policies against exploding
offers or other unreasonable pressure for computer science
students.

Thanks!
```

### Tiers

#### Really Good

The offer guidelines give multiple months for internship decisions made in the fall. No company is in **_desperate need_** of an intern, it's perfectly reasonable for a company to give you a fair amount of time to decide something that's months away.

#### Good

The offer guidelines give at least 3 weeks for internships and full time offers.

#### Okay

The offer guidelines only protect internships.

### Example: University of Illinois

The engineering department of University of Illinois has a program that looks like this:

![offer](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/vl861bzxnv0euk12a2eq.png)

[Source](https://ecs.engineering.illinois.edu/career-resources/offer-guidelines/)

## Does the school have regular career fairs attended by tech companies you've heard of?

This is your primary access to employment opportunities. If the university does not have companies coming to their career fair, something is _very_ wrong.

Many companies _only_ hire university grads through these fairs, so by going to a school without a real career fair, you're paying 200k to have _less_ access to jobs.

### Questions to ask

**Does a company have to pay?** Many universities _charge_ companies to attend their career fair. This is a sign that the university has _so many_ companies who want to attend that they have to limit it. If the career fair is free, the university is lacking applicants.

**Does the university have a CS only career fair?** Some schools are so popular that they move CS into its own fair. This is primarily at bigger schools, but hits midsize as well.

**Are companies that attend traveling?** If a company had to travel to the fair, they _really_ want to hire people here. It also means that the company is offering internships that pay for housing elsewhere, which typically is a sign of higher paid and higher quality internships. Companies that can afford housing typically can afford higher pay.

### Example: San Jose State University

![SJSU](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lggcu5fu4lb5isbndqkd.png)
[Source](http://www.sjsu.edu/careercenter/employers/job-internship-fairs/index.html)

## Does the school have course offerings for interviews?

When you go to interview for jobs, you'll be asked to solve coding challenges, often in a timed, under-pressure situation. This practice may change in the future, but it's _extremely_ common.

Any CS program worth its salt has created a class that preps students for this.

If a school does _not_ have this course, it means their CS department is _extremely_ disconnected from the industry or they do not adapt well. **🚩This is a red flag; if you do not see this, bail.**

### How to find out

Try the following search queries in Google:

```
{COLLEGE I WANT} interviewing cs course
{COLLEGE I WANT} technical interviews cs
```

If they have nothing available, copy/paste this email and send it to a CS Professor at the school or their office of admissions:

```
Hi!

I'm a prospective student doing research on your university.
Do you have a course dedicated to passing technical interviews as a computer science major?

Thanks!
```

### Example: Boise State University

&gt; CS-HU 390 TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS, JOBS, AND CAREERS (1-0-1)(F). Prepare students for computer science technical interviews. Demonstrate how knowledge gained in classes can be used to solve new problems. Encourage teamwork and peer feedback. Learn how to negotiate jobs and manage career growth. A Hatchery Unit (HU) course is a short course to develop specific professional skills for computer science. (Pass/Fail) PREREQ: CS-HU 130, CS 253, CS 321.

[source](https://registrar.boisestate.edu/undergraduate/course-catalog/cs-hu/)

## Do students have access to investment and capital?

Much of tech is funded by venture capitalists: investment firms who specialize in small startup companies. There's a number of investment firms that do small investments solely in companies started by college kids.

Some examples are:

- [Contrary Capital](https://contrarycap.com/team)
- [Dorm Room Fund](https://www.dormroomfund.com/team)
- [Rough Draft VC](http://www.roughdraft.vc/)

Many universities have their own version of this. Some will offer N thousand dollars to students as part of a grant.

Even if you _don't_ want to start a startup, having these opportunities are _extremely_ valuable. Maybe _you_ didn't start something, but Sally did and now she's hooking you up with a sweet job.

Companies that start out of a university often go back and hire from that university. That creates a network of opportunity for you, even if you're not making the next Facebook.

Plus, having outside funding means that some market somewhere has effectively ""bought in"" to this school and its programs. Those investors likely did better research than you or I did, so it's reasonable to take their hint here.

### How to find out

You can go to the big three college funds websites, though many of them are only available at brand name schools.

Another way is to email their admissions department the following:

```
Hi!

I'm a prospective student doing research on your university.
Have any tech companies been founded by your students while they were
students here? If so, how did they get initial funding? Are there
grants or other services that the university provides to CS students?

Thanks!
```

Be skeptical of places that have money _only_ for business majors.

### Example: University of Maryland

UMD has access to Contrary Capital and Oculus Rift was born here. Lesser known companies like [FiscalNote](https://fiscalnote.com/) came out of this program as well, along with bioscience companies, like Digene and Martek Biosciences.

## Does the university have access to a tech scene?

Preferably, it's one of the big 3 tech scenes:

- San Francisco and the Bay Area (the largest by far)
- New York
- Seattle

But it doesn't have to be. You want a place that has local companies interested in hiring local people. This is where you could get a part time co-op job or a summer internship without having to leave campus.

A lot of cities have tech scenes, but the size doesn't guarantee anything. Take Boise and Spokane.

Boise's current population is 226k and Spokane's is 217k. They're both about the same size, they both have a few universities that rest there, but only one has a tech scene.

One of Boise's primary distinguishers is the presence of ""key stone"" companies like HP and Micron. These companies put major offices in the town, which attracted a number of tech workers. After some time, these tech workers left and started their own companies. Some of these formed into midsized places and small startups.

### How to find out

When looking at a school, search for tech companies in the area. If you're only seeing smaller or mid-sized places, be skeptical. You want a large company to have invested resources into building an office there. Those big companies are making a larger investment than you are and frequently do a lot more research on the market there.

## Does the school have access to Hackathons?

A Hackathon is where many programmers go to a college campus, program for 24 hours straight and then maybe win cash money. They may be for you, or maybe they're not, but there's no denying that access to them can be effective.

Many students get jobs from hackathons. Winning one is a resume item when often you don't have a whole lot to put down. They're opportunities to meet other smart programmers and to explore new tech.

Even if you _never_ go to a hackathon, you'll still benefit. The people who _do_ go will network for you and be your 2nd or 3rd connection to job opportunities.

### Questions to ask

- Does the university host a hackathon?
- If not, is it in the local area?
- If not, does it sponsor students to go?
- If not, are students finding other ways to go?

# Summary

Overall, you're looking for a school that:

- Has a solid understanding of the tech industry
- Has _support_ for students entering the tech industry
- Succeeds at _getting_ students into the tech industry

These should be your _base line_ goals. The feel of the university, the professors, and the campus are good tie breakers.

University is about growing as a person. There's _huge_ benefits to going to a place that will expose you to stuff you've never thought about. But weigh that benefit with the debt you're taking on.

Many students get jobs from hackathons. Winning one is a resume item when often you don't have a whole lot to put down. They're opportunities to meet other smart programmers and to explore new tech.

Even if you _never_ go to a hackathon, you'll still benefit. The people who _do_ go will network for you and be your 2nd or 3rd connection to job opportunities.

### Questions to ask

- Does the university host a hackathon?
- If not, is it in the local area?
- If not, does it sponsor students to go?
- If not, are students finding other ways to go?

# Summary

Overall, you're looking for a school that:

- Has a solid understanding of the tech industry
- Has _support_ for students entering the tech industry
- Succeeds at _getting_ students into the tech industry

These should be your _base line_ goals. The feel of the university, the professors, and the campus are good tie breakers.

University is about growing as a person. There's _huge_ benefits to going to a place that will expose you to stuff you've never thought about. But weigh that benefit with the debt you're taking on.

Of cause all of this very subjectively, and you can define your plan. There is a lot of differences between regions, countries and so on. But this one gives at least some level of overview.

There will be no links to exact learning materials, you can add them in the comments.

Also, I plan to review this schema with additional details [on stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj-Jclhy9Qg) by 17th May, 8pm PST.

# What we expect from every level?
Let's define our expectations. Your expectations may differ.

**Level 1** — new basic tags, can edit the content on ready HTML site, can format the text properly, can insert some embedded thing (youtube, google map), can use git for himself (master, 1 contributor). He can make some simple sites, and it might look good (at his personal computer). Not a standalone unit, some guidance required to succeed.

**Level 2** — plus-minus standalone unit (or standalone for small-medium projects). He can create a fine layout from scratch for a small-medium project, and it will look great in all modern browsers. Know how to work with template engines, can use them (if another code is provided). Can plan his work well, document what was done and how to use it can estimate time. Understand the importantness of code style. Understand why grid systems and CSS frameworks exist. Can collect required information by himself from designers or from mockups. He can interact with small to medium teams. He can create branches and pull requests.

**Level 3** — can design a block system for a big project from scratch. Know how to avoid duplicated code and problems when his code will be used by other developers. He can decomposite complex problems and define tasks well. He can apply at least one modern methodology (BEM, for example). He can make the site blazingly fast. Well understanding couple of modern template engines. Can create build scripts to automate the CSS/HTML/js combination process. Can do code review well and teach other frontenders.

# Exact blocks explanation
Most of the blocks represent some type of skillset. It can be replaced with a similar one. You can use any IDE, any CMS or whatever. I just point some popular ones, with ones you can start work ""right now"" (there is a lot of related job offers). There can be a lot of job offers for other skills in your area. I had tried to make a universal schema that will work for most regions.

## Level 1

**HTML** — knowledge of basic tags and attributes. Understanding how to write HTML (what is ""tag"", ""property"", etc)
**Typography** — proper text formatting. Text — the base of (nearly) every project. Add no-breaking-spaces where is required, bold, cursive, abbr, etc. Use some kind of typographer or similar service, understand why +1&amp;nbsp;234&amp;nbsp;567 better than +1 234 567.
**Fonts** (can be postponed) — more complicated than looks like; I recommend for beginners to use system fonts. Ability to load fonts, to fall back to another one, optimize look/speed, minimize render time for custom fonts.
**Semantics** — ability to find a proper tag for proper usage. Understanding why so many tags exist.
**Media** — types of media can be displayed on a page
**Iframe** — import 3rd party widgets (video, audio, maps, etc)
**Audio, Video** (can be postponed) — can be solved with iframes initially. Understanding what types of media are supported by browsers, know how to design player and etc.
**Images** — graphic formats, how they work in browsers. Procs and cons for different formats
**Raster** — jpg, png, gif. Understand differences and ability to choose proper one (maybe optimize them).
**SVG** (can be postponed) — Procs/cons/limitations, how to use.
Tables (optional, good for email letters) — but tables itself should be learned under ""HTML"" :-)

**CSS 1** — fonts, colors, aligning, sizes
**CSS 2.1** — blocks behavior, positioning, design
**Selectors** — simple selectors on tag, class, nested element. Simple pseudo-selectors, like :hover.
**Naming** — how to name classes to avoid pain in future
**Blocks** — how to split mockup to separate blocks, how to implement these blocks in HTML and design with CSS

**Browsers** (can be postponed) — which browsers exist, what the difference.
**Dev Tools** (can be postponed) — Use browser tools to identify why something looks wrong, how to ""debug"" CSS

**Code editors** — what editors exist, why they exist. Notepad++ and SublimeText here just for example as well known ones. Know how to set basic settings like tabs, newlines, charset and so on.

**VCS** (Version Control System) — I believe that this is a must, at least for yourself. Why they exist, and what types.
**Git/ Bitbucket** — be able to use at least one of the popular platforms for git
**Checkout / commit / push / pull** — base operations enough for personal usage
**Stash** — for temporary saving not required at this moment things

**10 works** — a minimum of 10 works with a different design. Maybe it just formatted text or whatever. But they should use the maximum of your current knowledge.

## Level 2

**CSS 3** — gradients, shadows, roundings, filters, transformations, etc.
Advanced selectors — combined selectors with usage like ""+"", nth-child, shadow-dom, before/after and so on
**Flexbox** — understand model, be able to use it
**Animations** (optional) — transition, animation. Proc/cons/limitations.
**Grids** — why they exist, how to use them, what ready solutions exist. As an example, you can take a look at ""Flexbox grid"" or any other one
**Frameworks** — why exists, how to use. I highly recommend learning good at least one of them. Very useful for prototyping. Dramatically increase the quality of the project with no designers (internal project, for example).
**CSS preprocessors** (can be postponed) — better code organized and clean code, mixins, variables, etc. Try different ones like SASS, LESS, Stylus
**Media queries** (can be postponed) — show proper style depending on conditions (device, screen size, print version, etc)
**Email letters** (optional) — useful skill; There are dozens of mail systems with some differences, and the main goal is to make your letter looks good in any of them, on any device. Know how to pass filters and not go to spam.
**Polyfills** — understand how to use modern semantics with back compatibility. Know proc/cons.
**Cross-platform** — understand hot to make the site not just for Windows, Mac, and Linux, but for SmartTV, PS, kindle and so on.

**Mobile** (can be postponed) — understand mobile platform limitations. Use space wisely.

**Optimization** (can be postponed) — understand the ""price"" of different techniques. Understand browser phases to display site to a user
**Loading** (can be postponed) — Optimizations, related to size, cache, combining resources, etc.
**Paint** (can be postponed) — Optimizations of render after (on in progress) load
**SEO** (can be postponed) — At least a basic understanding of search engines. Ability to help to them understand your site, what is important and so on

**Template engines** — how to reuse code, how to group elements, how to assemble pages. Very important to understand both: server and client rendering. There are also pure-language templates, like direct PHP code parts. Parts before the template engine is out of scope.
**PHP** (can be postponed) — understand basic syntax and be able to add small changes, related to page design
**CMS** (can be postponed) — know, what type of CMS exists, why they were created. Learn how to write templates to at least one of them (Wordpress is recommended)

**Jquery** (can be postponed) — learn how to save a lot of time for the small/medium project by using ready plugins for common tasks
**NodeJS** (can be postponed) — learn how to run the simplest server, serve static files, render on the server-side. Maybe use express or so.
Build systems (can be postponed) — how to assemble a project from CSS/HTML files. Highly recommend to at least take a look at few different systems (grunt - gulp).

**Code style** — why people agree on some styles, learn at least one and start using it (take a look at Airbnb one, or for any modern js framework like Vue)
**DRY / KISS / SOLID** (can be postponed) — important theories of development, dramatically affect project support in the future.
**OOCSS** (optional) — what is object-oriented CSS? Why and how to use? In some form used in most of the projects (but without understanding that they use it :-D). Ideally, learn how to design it. It can be very useful for big projects.
**Documentation** (can be postponed) — understand how and what to document. Start to document. Markdown syntax highly recommended.

**Planning** — learn how to estimate time by just look on the image, define the order of works
Decomposition (can be postponed) — split the big task into small ones. It is harder than it looks.
Settings goals (can be postponed) — be able to write tasks that way, that other developers (including ones, that lower level than you), will able to understand them clearly.

**IDE** (can be postponed) — why IDE exists, how to use them. Learning any IDE is equal to learn some programming language (otherwise you will not utilize its power). I, personally, use just text editors and run IDE only for really big projects.

**Branching** — control branches in git
**Merge** — learn how to merge branches that have merge conflicts
**Fetch / Rebase** (optional) — what is this? Learn how and when to use

**Graphic editors** — understand different types of them, what is the difference between vector and raster. Be able to read mockups from the designer in them. Be able to choose a proper font, size, color, and other things, to make the site looks exactly like the designer asks you to.

**Web accessibility** — crucial, if you're a good person. Make your site accessible by disabled people.

**Regional differences** (optional) — left-to-right, right-to-left, and other crazy things of Arabic (or any other) market. There are dozens of fun things.

**50 works** — at the end of ""Level 2"" you should have about 50 different projects, that show your skills. (If this is a project with 20 totally different layouts, count it as 20).

## Level 3
On schema this part looks like the smallest one, but, in fact, this is the largest one, because at this moment you should know all ""can be postponed"" things.


**Adaptive/responsive** — highest level; combine all your knowledge! The project should look awesome anywhere and on anything.
**Graceful Degradation / Progressive enchantment** — why it is good, how to use it. Use.
**Gitflow** (or another branching model) — be able to utilize some good practice, be able to explain to another developer how to use git, were to merge branches, how to do code review (of HTML/CSS)
**BEM** (optional) — Learn some methodology that gives the ability to create unlimited large projects that way, so with minimum synchronization, different teams will able to use blocks from each other. There is a lot of methodologies that give the same/better result. At this moment of time, you will hear about some of them and will be able to choose one wisely.

**100 works** — sounds like a nice goal, as for me. They should show the different skills that you have. But you can have just one work (consist of different parts) in the portfolio, that will show that you do not afraid of anything.

Hello,

My name is Gancho Radkov I am a self taught developer.

In 2016 It took me \~5 months to get a job as developer from complete beginner. Since then I've climbed to lead developer in german web agency.

I am currently leading a team of 5 developers - 1 self taught, 4 with Masters in CS.

I've decided that I would like to help others who wish to become web developers/learn to code  
but can not go college or university for whatever reason by creating a platform and with an educational material,exersices and real-world projects.

Now I am extremely happy to announce that after 17 MONTHS in the making... the platform is finally open!

We are starting with over 95 tutorials in 5 topics including -  
HTML 5  
CSS 3  
Bootstrap   
JavaScript  
Jquery  
and I am recording more tutorials every day!

If you are serious about learning web development and you are willing to do the work, I am willing to teach you everything I know.

Hello,

My name is Gancho Radkov I am a self taught developer.

In 2016 It took me \~5 months to get a job as developer from complete beginner. Since then I've climbed to lead developer in german web agency.

I am currently leading a team of 5 developers - 1 self taught, 4 with Masters in CS.

I've decided that I would like to help others who wish to become web developers/learn to code  
but can not go college or university for whatever reason by creating a platform and with an educational material,exersices and real-world projects.

Now I am extremely happy to announce that after 17 MONTHS in the making... the platform is finally open!

We are starting with over 95 tutorials in 5 topics including -  
HTML 5  
CSS 3  
Bootstrap   
JavaScript  
Jquery  
and I am recording more tutorials every day!

If you are serious about learning web development and you are willing to do the work, I am willing to teach you everything I know.  
It is hard, It is dificult, there is a lot to learn, but it is possible to be web developer! Only if you do the work!

With your suggestions I was able to achieve much better overall quality.

I'm here for second wave of suggestions :-)

Example of one of recent videos (I like this one regardless of simpliness): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B0yQGeWFWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B0yQGeWFWQ)

Regardless of focus on JavaScript for now, I believe it valuable for any language. At least I try to explain that way, so it will be reproducible.

&amp;#x200B;

What was done from your suggestions:

1. Screen zoomed in, so it is comfortable to watch on phones

2. Quick introduction added to each vide

3. Each video has a plan (that pronounced at start of video): observe problem, design algorithm, calculate complexity, optimize, code, check complexity and findings

4. Draw an algorithm in paint for better understanding

5. Explain every single important thing in every video. Like what is space complexity, what is time complexity., 

6. Separate 1 task for 1 video

7. Add previews with some labels (language, platform, problem name)

8. Add links to problems itself

9. Publish streams topics and link to problems earlier, so you can solve it before stream (but I still not open problems itself before stream :-D)

10. Create 3 playlists (easy, medium, hard)

11. Keep better pace to keep video short

12. Start using Leetcode as a second platform as was requested

&amp;#x200B;

What is one the list now:

1. Channel appearance (name, icon, background, etc)

2. Some background for me, instead of bed :-D

3. Use some tablet, to speedup draws

4. Rotate easy/medium/hard topics (for some time had focus on easy ones, to train myself to explain everything properly)

5. Add streams/videos from leetcode premium content (like mocking interview)

6. Better schedule

7. Some interactive

Please, help me get to next level and start creating better content.

One of main concerns is about making video more interactive. How we can do this? Like with some homework, sharing results and so on.

4639,"Hi,

This might be a more complicated question to this subreddit as it's not a coding question, but a development strategy.

I'm an experienced developer for about 15 years, but have been out of the loop for about 3 (which I know is a long time.)

I have a client who has a small business that needs a software solution (UI intensive, this is important), but his profit margins are razor thin, and therefore any investment in development needs to be very justified. I wrote the current version of the app about 5 years ago, when ExtJS (Touch) was the big hype for cross-platform touch screen development. 5 years later, the framework is now obsolete and bugs are slowly creeping up (Chrome already rolled out two breaking changes by accident, cute story, just search their bugs for Sencha Touch to see my bug filings.)

I now need to advise my client what to do with the next, bigger version of their app. They are willing to pay what's needed, but we can't have a redo of this 5 years from now. Whatever we write needs to stick.

With all the framework hell, abandoned open-source plugins and questionable business motives of these open source projects, am I crazy for considering writing the core (and maybe even the UI?) in C++ to ensure that even 10 years from now we won't have to re-write again? I know I can upgrade to ExtJS 6 (and soon 7) but Sencha has disappointed once before, and they just got bought by Idera, so I don't know how stable they are.

4651,"Hi guys!

I wanted to thank everyone for this sub and share a little bit of my story.

I'm a sound engineer and last July I hurt my knee - I did as many shows as I could after the injury but about 3 weeks ago realized that my body simply cannot move gear anymore and that isn't going to change. If you can't move gear you can't work. I talked to the guys from my crew and told them they'd better find someone else for this season. That was really hard.

I thought about going into studio recording but it's difficult to find consistent work and at 48 it'd be a pretty big risk to try to break in that way.

So I looked around at what jobs are available and pay a living wage and landed on software developer. I'm not new to the  software industry - I was a technical writer at one of the big companies in the early 2000s - but I am new to the developer path.

Anyhow I started on my journey two weeks ago and last night I finished the first working sample of my [first project](https://github.com/ttreit/RPS-Python).

It's a simple rock, paper, scissors game in Python but it's my very own! I really enjoy the work and learning and solving problems so I'm excited to keep going.

I've also had a lot of nagging doubts that I can go from rock, paper, scissors to a dev job and what happens when you are assigned something you can't solve or struggle to solve...I'm sure all the same doubts most people have.

Oh and to everyone who said the key to learning is to pick a project - ANY PROJECT - and just do it, you are all 1000% correct. Not only was it way more fun, it forces you to really understand how things work.   I did it! - First little program done.",t5_2r7yd,science and tech,"Hi guys!

4653,"All the below code examples are **JavaScript**, but are hopefully easy to follow along if you know your `if/else`. Let me know if there's any confusion or if you have any questions.

I've copied the whole article here, but there's a link at the bottom to the original with syntax highlighting if it helps.

#How Many Is Too Many?

Some people think that number is *one* and you should always substitute at least a ternary for any single `if` statements. I don't take that staunch of an approach, but I want to highlight some ways to escape common `if/else` spaghetti code.

I believe a lot of developers fall into the if/else trap so easily, not because of the complexity of other solutions, but because it follows such a natural language pattern:

`if` something do this, `else` do this instead.

#Wait, What's a Ternary?

A ternary isn't a revolutionary difference from an `if/else` as they're both conditional operations, but a ternary does return a value so it can be used directly in an assignment.

    const greaterThanFive = (8 &gt; 5) ? 'yep' : 'nope';
    
    console.log(greaterThanFive); // 'yep'

The basic pattern is just a condition, one value to return if truthy, and one value to return if falsy.

    (condition) ? isTruthy : isFalsy

#An alternative to If/Else

Let's start with a scenario and walk through examples of different solutions.

We'll be taking colors from user input and need to turn them into some preset color codes to match so we can change our background color. So we'll check for strings of color names and set our color code if we have a match.

    const setBackgroundColor = (colorName) =&gt; {
        let colorCode = '';
        if(colorName === 'blue') {
            colorCode = '#2196F3';
        } else if(colorName === 'green') {
            colorCode = '#4CAF50';
        } else if(colorName === 'orange') {
            colorCode = '#FF9800';
        } else if(colorName === 'pink') {
            colorCode = '#E91E63';
        } else {
            colorCode = '#F44336';
        };
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = colorCode;
    };

This `if/else` gets the job done. But we're saddled with a lot of repetitive logic comparing `colorName` and repetitive assignment of `colorCode`.

#Switch

Now we could more appropriately change this into a `switch` statement. It better fits the concept of what we're trying to do; We have several cases of strings we want to match, and a default if none of our cases match.

    const setBackgroundColor = (colorName) =&gt; {
        let colorCode = '';
        switch(colorName) {
            case 'blue':
                colorCode = '#2196F3';
                break;
            case 'green':
                colorCode = '#4CAF50';
                break;
            case 'orange':
                colorCode = '#FF9800';
                break;
            case 'pink':
                colorCode = '#E91E63';
                break;
            default:
                colorCode = '#f44336';
        };
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = colorCode;
    };

But a `switch` still comes with a lot of boilerplate and repetitive code we could do without.

#Lookup Table

So what are we really trying to accomplish here? We need to assign color codes in hex to color names, so let's create an object that holds color names as keys, and color codes as values. Then we can look up our color code by its color name by using `object[key]`. And we need a default value, so a short ternary that returns the default if no key is found will do so all while making the default part of our object.

    const colorCodes = {
        'blue'   : '#2196F3',
        'green'  : '#4CAF50',
        'orange' : '#FF9800',
        'pink'   : '#E91E63',
        'default': '#F44336'
    };

    const setBackgroundColor = (colorName) =&gt; {
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = colorCodes[colorName]
            ? colorCodes[colorName]
            : colorCodes['default'];
    };

Now we have a **lookup table** that neatly lays out our inputs and possible outputs.

This isn't about a miraculous 'lines of code' (LOC) reduction (we went from 15 to 20 to 12.) In fact, some of these solutions may increase your LOC, but we've increased maintainability, legibility, and actually reduced complexity by only having one logic check for a default fallback.

#Trade Logic For Data

The most important accomplishment of using a lookup table over an `if/else` or `switch` is that we've turned multiple instances of comparative logic into data. The code is more expressive; it shows the logic as an operation. The code is more testable; the logic has been reduced. And our comparisons are more maintainable; they're consolidated as pure data.

Let's reduce five comparative logic operations to one and transform our values into data.

Scenario: we need to convert grade percentages into their letter grade equivalent.

An `if/else` is simple enough; we check from top down if the grade is higher or equal than what's needed to match the letter grade.

    const getLetterGrade = (gradeAsPercent) =&gt; {
        if(gradeAsPercent &gt;= 90) {
            return ""A"";
        } else if(gradeAsPercent &gt;= 80) {
            return ""B"";
        } else if(gradeAsPercent &gt;= 70) {
            return ""C"";
        } else if(gradeAsPercent &gt;= 60) {
            return ""D"";
        } else {
            return ""F"";
        };
    };

But we're repeating the same logic operation over and over.

So let's extract our data into an array (to retain order) and represent each grade possibility as an object. Now we only have to do one `&gt;=` comparison on our objects and find the first in our array that matches.

    const gradeChart = [
        {minpercent: 90, letter: 'A'},
        {minpercent: 80, letter: 'B'},
        {minpercent: 70, letter: 'C'},
        {minpercent: 60, letter: 'D'},
        {minpercent: 0,  letter: 'F'}
    ];

    const getLetterGrade = (gradeAsPercent) =&gt; {
        return gradeChart.find(
            (grade) =&gt; {
                gradeAsPercent &gt;= grade.minpercent;
            };
        ).letter;
    };

#Start Imagining Your Comparisons As Data

When you need to compare or ""check"" values it's natural to reach for the `if/else` so you can verbally step through the problem. But next time try to think of how your values can be represented as data and your logic reduced to interpret that data.

Your code will end up being more readable, maintainable, and purposeful in its intent with a clear separation of the concepts it represents. All of the code examples here function, but the right approach can turn It Works™ Code into 'great to work with' code.

I am not a CS Major, never had experience with coding.

So I went ahead and enrolled in a C class. Although people do not recommend C for people who have 0 experience, I took the challenge.  My class is so interesting! I love it! I am so motivated that I decided to challenge myself and build something myself, without any instructions.

I thought of Final Exam Grade calculator. It is something that many students check and I find it really useful. Obviously it already exists so nothing new but I wanted to test myself and see if I am actually capable of building it instead of taking projects with instructions.

Right now at my free time I work on educational youtube channel about programming, algorithms and so on.

I pick some problems from hakerrank or similar portals and try to solve and explain same time. Without preparations.

&amp;#x200B;

I had split content for 3 types:

1. In pair with junior developer we pick some Easy problem, and focus on explanation related to data structures, algorithms and so on (example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbn5g\_5mc3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbn5g_5mc3E))

2. In pair with experienced developer (but who had not focus on algorithms in past) we pick some medium problem, and try to do everything in way like it happen in big companies (like google) (example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohs2x5d5Cug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohs2x5d5Cug))

3. Alone I pick some Hard problem, and try to solve it in time (example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5AtgDgMe9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5AtgDgMe9I))

I do not earn anything from this — do it just for fun in my free time (Every day at 8pm PST for 1 hour).

I'll be glad if some people here will participate in any of stream types.

\- Videos is too slow and not interested to see at all

\- Tasks are boring

\- Bad english

\- I solve problems too slow / looks unexperienced

\- No music on background or other kind of decorations

\- Not enough dedication on every video (read as ""I learn nothing after the video"")

\- etc

&amp;#x200B;

So I finished Automate the boring stuff which I thought was great. It game me and idea after watching the web scraping part. While my company monitor the tin for what our web applications are hosted on we didn't actually have a good monitoring solution to tell us performance and timings so after a lot of Google-Fu and messing around I managed to get something together and working that timed all the login duration's and search duration's too. It has gone down pretty well and my company want me to invest some time over the next few months to improve on it and iron out some of the bugs so we can replace something which costs £x0,000 a year which does similar but not quiet as well as what I managed to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing a course from code with mosh which has been good and I feel I'm slowly starting to get things a bit more, I'm only about 35% of the way through the course but I feel some things are slowly starting to click. I will say that I literally have a very poor memory in that I get to exercises and literally always draw a blank but I'm just plodding along. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was also pretty happy today in that I wrote a program, again from initial Google-Fu, reading some documentation and examples and slowly trying to work out errors which monitors something which we have never been able to monitor before, something which an external company quoted us $3,500 to do and I managed to get this working in an afternoon which was a real good feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't dedicated as much time as I should have to learning, I've moved house and got a lot of stuff going on at the moment but I try and do as much as I can. When I'm tired I try not to because I just don't seem to get stuff. Like I said I'm slowly getting things but my memory on how to implement things isn't there yet but then I am only 3 months in. 

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing with my code which I know isn't good is there is some instances where I am not following DRY especially with my early code, I know how to improve on this though and rather than having 20 definitions in my code I can achieve the same with maybe 1 or 2 and string formatting or maybe implement a few classes.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I'm still a long way from being able to code without Google or without looking at examples and editing them to suite my need but again I want to thank this sub and many other coding subs like learnpython etc. I am currently working in DevOps and have found that from learning what I've learn so far from courses and hands on experience I'm able to  use some of that knowledge to help me troubleshoot and fix issues in my day job. I have a lot of great ideas I'd like to implement and a lot of things I'd like to automate and I'm excited to see what I'm able to achieve once I've expanded my knowledge and can actually start remembering things :)

I’m currently studying Swift, and I’m keen for it as it has a job guarantee when I graduate their course, and I’m currently 4 months in.

I’ve been working at a tech company as tech support for the past 2 years, and I’ve been recently hired to a database company for tech support as well. I decided to make the move as compensation was better and company was better too.

They mentioned that if there’s no one that needs tech support, my downtime would be used for projects that will help automate processes, thus python.

My question is would it be confusing if I were to learn both programming languages at the same time? Should I maybe do python first? Or keep going with Swift?

I like doing Swift although it’s a lot harder than I expected (a lot of people say Swift is an easy language, I’m honestly having trouble learning it) I also have a bit of background doing C# in college for game development.

4686,"I graduated with a bachelors degree in Informatics (water down CS degree pretty much) and a minor in economics almost a decade ago.

Took me hundreds of job applications to get 1 offer.

I was let go at my first job (small company) after 5 months because “I wasn’t a good fit”.

They had very high expectations, strict deadlines, and for a while I thought I was the problem. 

I get my second job at a bigger company and thought this will be a better environment for me.

I asked the dev lead for advice and feedback about a year in and he was very honest. He said that he doesn’t see me making it past the junior/mid level and that I should consider other roles within tech.

I felt like a pile of dirt after that. I felt worthless. 

I told my friends about this (who are in tech) and they basically told me “fuck this guy, that’s incredibly toxic” and convinced me to find a new gig.

Now, maybe they were just talking crap because they felt bad for me and wanted to make me feel better.

Regardless, I transitioned to my next job at a very well known company with a huge tech presence. I was surrounded by smart, humble individuals willing to help someone who is willing to help themselves.

I felt like I was getting smarter each day. I can’t pinpoint exactly what happened but the environment made me feel more relaxed and made me want to come to work.

Since joining that company I got my masters in CS and was promoted twice all the way to a senior within the span of 6 years.

4689,"**BACKGROUND:**

During my teens, I spent years trying to write game engines as a self-taught programmer with no luck.

I'm currently a professional business applications developer earning over $100k / yr. Here's a few realizations I had:

**Focus on the PROBLEM SPACE you want a solution to**

Step away from the SOLUTION SPACE until you fully understand the problem you want to solve or task you want to accomplish.

Solution-oriented items, such as pseudocode, technical design, programming, etc. should come AFTER you've acquired a grasp of what it is you actually want to do.

This is not a strict rule, but I would step back and think about what it is you are actually trying to do if you find yourself spending more than 45 minutes without making any measurable progress.

WHY: To avoid coding yourself into a hole. You *may* be able to solve problems by coding yourself around them, but why take that chance?

**Project progress should be measured by PROBLEMS SOLVED, not CODE WRITTEN**

Or perhaps even problems understood, as noted above, since a deep understanding of problems will often make crafting solutions easier.

This tip is a bit of a throwback to my game engine days. It's easy to write things like ""entity loaders"", ""input handlers"", ""collision handlers"", ""dynamic resource managers"" without ever having a game or putting graphics on the screen.

Similarly, many people seem to get stuck wondering how they actually create a project from start to finish.

Don't feel ashamed if you need to watch a Youtube video to help you out, use a prototyping or wireframing tool, whatever helps you reach your target faster.

If you like the puzzle-solving aspect of programming and feel like looking stuff up is cheating... don't worry, you can fill the gaps back in later. Better to look up how to do it right and veer yourself back on course than waste years writing a ""game engine"" that can do a million things except make people say, ""Wow, this game is fun.""

**That being said, you WILL need to learn BASIC SYNTAX, ALGORITHMS, DATA STRUCTURES, and COMMON METHODS AND PATTERNS first**

That's a bit wordy, but everyone uses programming differently. Some people see it as a collection of tools and functions they call at various times in order to build applications. Others care more about the abstract architecture behind programs, how they actually execute, etc.

You can honestly get a job programming either way. Figure out your threshold and risk tolerance (more abstract / computer-sciencey programming will cost more upfront but probably give more job security down the line) and get going.

Take some intro to programming courses and just stick through with them. I recommend something like the first three courses in UC Berkeley's computer science program, which are available online for free. That's 61A, 61B, 61C. Others have recommended Harvard CS50x.

The gist is, find ONE or just a FEW *really good* courses on programming. Stick through with them. Should require at most a few months of effort (maybe longer for multiple courses). But you will learn a *ton* that will stick with you for a long time.

If you watch ""how to"" videos on Youtube or get Udacity or Udemy courses, you will probably be able to get going even faster.

**Losing motivation? Lacking project ideas? Not sure what to do?**

Okay, do you actually want to program? Have you taken a walk outside lately? Do you have a life outside of sitting in front of the computer all day?

I mean, there are literally lists of project ideas, communities where people program together, all sorts of stuff.

I think it's both fair and healthy to re-evaluate your life frequently, enjoy a sunset, and reassure yourself whether or not you actually want to do this.

What motivates each person is going to be different, so I can't tell anyone specifically what to do. Just know that it is absolutely normal to get demotivated learning programming, to feel like a failure, struggle with simple things like getting your code to compile, etc.

Programming is an odd career. I mean, even when things go well, I spend more time debugging and validating code than I do writing it and enjoying the end result.

That kind of love-hate relationship with work isn't for everyone. Figure out what's best for you.

**PRO TIP:**

* Debugging is the #1 skill I want a developer to have. Programming who can step through code and evaluate the environment watch conditions are ""teach themselves to fish"" kind of people. When I work with a junior on my team, I am constantly reminding them to first step through things in the debugger rather than try coding themselves out of a problem. The debugger will tell you exactly what code is *actually* doing, not just what you think it's doing and then you wind up confused and making code changes until your program somehow magically works.

Or perhaps even problems understood, as noted above, since a deep understanding of problems will often make crafting solutions easier.

This tip is a bit of a throwback to my game engine days. It's easy to write things like ""entity loaders"", ""input handlers"", ""collision handlers"", ""dynamic resource managers"" without ever having a game or putting graphics on the screen.

Similarly, many people seem to get stuck wondering how they actually create a project from start to finish.

Don't feel ashamed if you need to watch a Youtube video to help you out, use a prototyping or wireframing tool, whatever helps you reach your target faster.

If you like the puzzle-solving aspect of programming and feel like looking stuff up is cheating... don't worry, you can fill the gaps back in later. Better to look up how to do it right and veer yourself back on course than waste years writing a ""game engine"" that can do a million things except make people say, ""Wow, this game is fun.""

**That being said, you WILL need to learn BASIC SYNTAX, ALGORITHMS, DATA STRUCTURES, and COMMON METHODS AND PATTERNS first**

That's a bit wordy, but everyone uses programming differently. Some people see it as a collection of tools and functions they call at various times in order to build applications. Others care more about the abstract architecture behind programs, how they actually execute, etc.

You can honestly get a job programming either way. Figure out your threshold and risk tolerance (more abstract / computer-sciencey programming will cost more upfront but probably give more job security down the line) and get going.

Take some intro to programming courses and just stick through with them. I recommend something like the first three courses in UC Berkeley's computer science program, which are available online for free. That's 61A, 61B, 61C. Others have recommended Harvard CS50x.

The gist is, find ONE or just a FEW *really good* courses on programming. Stick through with them. Should require at most a few months of effort (maybe longer for multiple courses). But you will learn a *ton* that will stick with you for a long time.

If you watch ""how to"" videos on Youtube or get Udacity or Udemy courses, you will probably be able to get going even faster.

**Losing motivation? Lacking project ideas? Not sure what to do?**

Okay, do you actually want to program? Have you taken a walk outside lately? Do you have a life outside of sitting in front of the computer all day?

I mean, there are literally lists of project ideas, communities where people program together, all sorts of stuff.

I think it's both fair and healthy to re-evaluate your life frequently, enjoy a sunset, and reassure yourself whether or not you actually want to do this.

What motivates each person is going to be different, so I can't tell anyone specifically what to do. Just know that it is absolutely normal to get demotivated learning programming, to feel like a failure, struggle with simple things like getting your code to compile, etc.

Programming is an odd career. I mean, even when things go well, I spend more time debugging and validating code than I do writing it and enjoying the end result.

That kind of love-hate relationship with work isn't for everyone. Figure out what's best for you.

**PRO TIP:**

* Debugging is the #1 skill I want a developer to have. Programming who can step through code and evaluate the environment watch conditions are ""teach themselves to fish"" kind of people. When I work with a junior on my team, I am constantly reminding them to first step through things in the debugger rather than try coding themselves out of a problem. The debugger will tell you exactly what code is *actually* doing, not just what you think it's doing and then you wind up confused and making code changes until your program somehow magically works.",I'm a self-taught developer with nearly a decade of industry experience.

""I want to thank those of you who alerted us to a document recently released by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) called “CRNAs: We are the Answer.”

I was disappointed to read this malicious statement. However, there is little that’s new here. This is the same recycled, reformatted misinformation the organization has spread for years. We saw it during our campaign to preserve high-quality care in the VA. We saw it in New York last year. We have seen it this year in the seven states where the AANA and its state societies attempted to dismantle existing patient safety standards that ensured patient access to physician-led, team-based models of anesthesia. It didn’t persuade anyone at the VA or in New York or in states like Oklahoma or Arkansas. In each case, physician-delivered and physician-led care was preserved. I commend our members in those states who worked so hard for their patients.

In debate after debate, ASA has successfully responded to the misinformation the AANA foists upon state and federal policymakers. We point out that “nurse anesthesiologist” is a shameless term created to confuse patients. We explain the vast difference in education, skills and training between our medical specialty and nurse anesthetists. We present the fact that the data cited by the AANA to suggest equivalency in care is from brazen, self-funded advocacy studies paid for by the AANA itself. We give policymakers the independent studies that show superior outcomes with the involvement of anesthesiologists. And we are now highlighting that team-based anesthesia is a World Health Organization standard. The AANA and its state societies throw a lot of contempt at our medical specialty. But the good news is that with professionalism and facts, we are winning. And when we win, our patients win.

This AANA document is little more than vitriol. It is about appropriating the name of our medical specialty, disrupting successful team-based models, and ridiculous accusations of “fraud,” “overcompensation” and “barriers.” For ASA and our members, it is all about our patients and what is best for them.

The AANA document simply does not reflect reality. Throughout the country, our members continue to work successfully with nurse anesthetists in a team-based model that frequently also includes anesthesiologist assistants. We are grateful to work with all members of the care team. ASA is committed to preserving and strengthening physician-delivered and physician-led team-based models because that is what is best for our patients. We won’t be distracted from this mission, and I ask that you continue to work with me to preserve our victories and build upon them.

4822,"""While portions of MO HB126 are encouraging, as a future physician I feel the need to tell you that the frank attack on the medical profession written into this bill, if not overturned, will cause an exodus of practicing and future physicians from Missouri.

""The provision: ""3. It shall be an affirmative defense for any person alleged to have violated the provisions of subsection 2 of this section that the person performed or induced an abortion because of a medical emergency. The defendant shall have the burden of persuasion that the defense is more probably true than not."" Places an impossible task on the physician who performs a medically necessary abortion, because there may be a physician, uninvolved in the case, that could be found by the state as ignorant of the details of the case or spiteful enough of his own profession who could be willing to testify against the decision made by the defendant - regardless of its validity. The state, by placing a physician performing a medically necessary abortion in the category of a felon until proven innocent, places a man or woman, whose holy and moral duty is to the good of their patient, in a legal vice – requiring them to not only make the difficult decision to end a life for the good of another, but also to determine (without legal representation in the moment) if the decision is legally provable as correct. Note the difference between medically correct and legally correct, here. A physician must, prior to performing a necessary and life saving abortion, collect and prepare a case absolving themselves of the decision - as this bill holds them guilty until proven innocent. Not only is this unconstitutional, but is also disrespectful to a profession far older and wiser than the state of Missouri, or even the United States itself.

""While I appreciate the provisions which encourage alternatives to abortions, and would like to encourage your office to continue exploring public policy in that regard, you do not have the authority to place anyone – let alone a physician in the reasonable pursuit of their holy responsibility to the safety of their patient – in the category of a felon, while also placing the burden of proof upon their shoulders.

""I will not practice medicine in Missouri if the aforementioned language is retained and passed into enforceable law, which would damage me greatly because I grew up, have family, and am being trained all within this great state.

[https://governor.mo.gov/contact-us](https://governor.mo.gov/contact-us)   I'm a Missouri resident and medical student, and I wrote a letter to Gov. Parson regarding HB126",t5_2qhff,science and tech,"""While portions of MO HB126 are encouraging, as a future physician I feel the need to tell you that the frank attack on the medical profession written into this bill, if not overturned, will cause an exodus of practicing and future physicians from Missouri.

""The provision: ""3. It shall be an affirmative defense for any person alleged to have violated the provisions of subsection 2 of this section that the person performed or induced an abortion because of a medical emergency. The defendant shall have the burden of persuasion that the defense is more probably true than not."" Places an impossible task on the physician who performs a medically necessary abortion, because there may be a physician, uninvolved in the case, that could be found by the state as ignorant of the details of the case or spiteful enough of his own profession who could be willing to testify against the decision made by the defendant - regardless of its validity. The state, by placing a physician performing a medically necessary abortion in the category of a felon until proven innocent, places a man or woman, whose holy and moral duty is to the good of their patient, in a legal vice – requiring them to not only make the difficult decision to end a life for the good of another, but also to determine (without legal representation in the moment) if the decision is legally provable as correct. Note the difference between medically correct and legally correct, here. A physician must, prior to performing a necessary and life saving abortion, collect and prepare a case absolving themselves of the decision - as this bill holds them guilty until proven innocent. Not only is this unconstitutional, but is also disrespectful to a profession far older and wiser than the state of Missouri, or even the United States itself.

""While I appreciate the provisions which encourage alternatives to abortions, and would like to encourage your office to continue exploring public policy in that regard, you do not have the authority to place anyone – let alone a physician in the reasonable pursuit of their holy responsibility to the safety of their patient – in the category of a felon, while also placing the burden of proof upon their shoulders.

""I will not practice medicine in Missouri if the aforementioned language is retained and passed into enforceable law, which would damage me greatly because I grew up, have family, and am being trained all within this great state. Missouri needs to protect and encourage physicians so we can continue to minister to and heal your constituents. Language such as this is inexcusable, and I believe the medical community deserves it to be overturned, and an apology.""

“I'd like to share some reflections on the death of a patient. I’ve thought about her a lot.

She gave me explicit consent to tweet the details of her case, about four hours before she died. Her hope was that someone might benefit from her experience.

/1
She came to hospital as octogenarians often do: with generalized weakness, falls, poor oral intake, fever, hypotension.

Her WBC was 17,000. Blood cultures grew E. coli.

Sepsis. Fixable enough.

/2
But she also complained of pain in her groin and thigh. It was new, progressive and debilitating.

Even moving around in her hospital bed was agonizing.

/3
A month earlier, she’d been found to have a large pseudoaneurysm arising from her external iliac artery.

(And yes, that’s a screw from a previous hip replacement traversing it.)

She underwent stenting and returned home.

/4

Because she was septic and in pain, we scanned her again. The new CT showed extensive gas within the pseudoaneurysm.

It was now infected, and that was a big problem.

/5

We continued antibiotics. She improved. We got her pain under reasonable control with hydromorphone and various other meds.

But then came the big question: “Now what?”

/6
She wanted no more surgery. Her mind was now sharp, and she was clear about that. 

But antibiotics alone weren’t going to cure the infection; they would only suppress it.

The best option, we suggested, would be antibiotics for the rest of her life.

/7
We discussed this option at length. She didn’t want it either. She explained why.
 
Pain was one reason. Meds helped a little, as long as she didn’t move around much. But our drug options were limited, and pain was going to be a persistent problem.

/8
Her even greater concern, looking forward, was quality of life.

Over the preceding months, she’d lost her mobility and independence. She wasn’t going to get them back and she knew it.

/9
She foresaw being confined to her apartment, in pain, struggling with her walker.

No more walks outside. No trips to the grocery store. No playing bridge with her friends, as she had done for years.

She wasn’t interested in living like that.

/10
We discussed palliative care: stopping antibiotics, increasing her pain meds, and keeping her comfortable while the infection took its course. Her family would keep vigil at her bedside for as long as it took.

She wasn’t interested in dying like that.

/11
She knew she was nearing the end of her life. What she wanted, she told us, was for it to end peacefully, with her mind still sharp, and her family and friends present. She wanted medical assistance in dying (MAiD).

/12
We held a family meeting. Relatives came from near and far.

They were unconditionally supportive. As it turned out, she’d discussed the prospect of MAiD, were it ever to become an option, several times in recent years.

So that became the plan.

/13
I saw her every day after that. Managed her pain. Listened to her stories. Learned about family members who’d died, and whose deaths had influenced her decision now.

Never once did she reconsider. I grew very fond of her, especially her wit and clear-eyed stoicism.

/14
After the requisite waiting period and medical assessments, the day had come.

I visited her at 7:30 that morning. She was alone but upbeat, eating Cheerios and toast from her tray.

(I still regret that this was her last meal. Wish I’d brought her a fresh bagel with lox.)

/15
A few hours later, her room was packed with family and friends. It was literally a party.

There was talking and laughing and cognac in Dixie cups. The mood was anything but funereal.

They gathered around her bed. I took a group photo. Everyone was smiling.

/16
I then watched as a colleague reviewed everything one last time, confirmed her wishes, explained what would happen, and answered everyone’s questions.

“Okay, I’m ready,” she said. Her composure was remarkable.

“Goodbye everyone. Thank you for everything. I love you all.”

/17
She received midazolam and dozed off peacefully, her children holding her hands and stroking her head.

Next came propofol, an anaesthetic.
Then rocuronium, a muscle relaxant.
Finally, potassium chloride, to stop her heart.

Five minutes after saying goodbye, she was dead.

/18
There were tears, of course. All around. But mostly the atmosphere in the room was one of serenity and gratitude, and a genuine sense of having done the right thing.

/19
I’m no MAiD expert, and I get that some people are opposed to it for various reasons. But I’ve been a doctor for 25 years, and I’ve seen enough deaths to know a good one from a bad one.

This was, without exaggeration, the best death I have ever witnessed.

/20
We all die eventually. This patient helped me realize that when my time comes, I'll be fortunate if MAiD is an option.

And I will always be thankful to her, her family, and a very skilled colleague for helping me appreciate just how good a “good death” can be.

4844,"#Why it doesn't work

Essentially, homeopathy is based on the belief that **like cures like**. In practice, this would mean that different symptoms would be treated using small amounts of substances that in bigger doses would cause them.

I do acknowledge that this ""like cures like"" principle has been scientifically researched, with the name **hormesis**. Because of these studies, it's widely accepted that a small amount of a substance can in some cases have a different effect on a cell than a higher dose. However, we don't know how rare this phenomenon is, and the alternate effect it causes isn't necessarily positive or desired at all. 

Practicioners of homeopathy generalize this very unclear and controversial theory by thinking anything that causes a symptom can cure it in low doses. For example, in 2018, naturopath and homeopathic practicioner Anke Zimmermann gave a 4-year-old boy a remedy containing the saliva of a rabid dog, to treat the boy's supposed anger management issues (which, by the way, are perfectly natural for children that age), aggression and poor sleep, claiming that the solution ""cured"" him. If the remedy actually contained the virus, this woman was literally endangering a child's life for some crazy pseudoscientific experiment, while probably charging the parents a significant sum of money for it.

Additionally, there is another, arguably even bigger problem with homeopathy. Homeopathic medicine is produced using a method called ""potentization."" This means mixing 1 part of the desired ingredient with 9 parts of water, then shaking the solution, then mixing 1 part of the mixture with 9 parts of water again, and repeating this process over and over again. Homeopaths claim that the less of the ingredient the final solution contains, the more effective it is. This leads to the ingredients being diluted into nonexistence: in almost all homeopathic remedies, not a single molecule remains of the original ingredient. And even remedies that do have something else than water or alcohol in them only contain a couple of molecules of it: not enough to cause any effect. Again, none of this has been scientifically proven to work, but to be honest, homeopathic ""doctors"" don't seem to care about science anyway.


#Research on homeopathy

Most medical institutions around the world have rejected homeopathy as pseudoscientific nonsense, and rightfully so. In 2015, Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council, one of the world's biggest and most respected health institutions, conducted a massive study on homeopathy, with over 1800 different studies systematically analyzing papers and documents related to the topic. They concluded that there was ""no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy is effective in treating health conditions.""
The NHMRC had already come to the same conclusion earlier, in 2014, when they found homeopathy to have no effect in treating any of the 68 different health conditions included in the study.
In 2010, BMJ (earlier known as the British Medical Journal) wrote an article proving that complementary medicines, such as homeopathy, are absolutely useless as substitutes for conventional medicine.
Even back in 2002, the British Pharmacological Society debunked homeopathy as completely ineffective.

These were only a few examples of the overwhelming majority of evidence clearly showing that homeopathy has no real curative powers. It's a fact at this point.

Most of, if not all of the ""evidence"" supporting homeopathy, however, is based on people's personal experiences. The problem with this is that these experiences originate from the subjective viewpoints of people who might be biased towards homeopathy, thinking it cured them for sure, when in reality there are tons of other possible reasons to someone recovering from a health condition. It could have been another treatment that was used alongside homeopathy that did the trick. It could have been a change of lifestyle. It could have simply been time: the human body fights for its health by itself. We all have powerful immune systems designed for keeping us alive and well.
Besides, what about all the people who didn't experience any help from homeopathy? We never see the homeopaths talk about them.

There is only one way homeopathic treatment could possibly help a human win over a disease or health condition: placebo. But it's an effect that applies to literally everything. You could eat a piece of candy, and believing in it enough, it could make you feel less ill. Funnily enough, that's basically what homeopathy is all about.


#Why it's unethical

Homeopathic doctors act like kind-hearted and helpful people, who embrace the idea of ""natural"" medicine as a way of healing for everyone. Some of them, I'm sure, truly believe their own lies. But this empathy is also a way to attract customers. Homeopathy is a big business, and a very greedy one.

These mixtures of water and alcohol are being sold to unsuspecting people as a risk-free, non-invasive cure to a plethora of different diseases/symptoms, usually as a liquid or in the form of small sugar pills. The problem with this is that even though they have no effect whatsoever, they are highly expensive, disguise themselves as real medicine and deceive people who often have chronic, painful, difficult, crippling diseases or conditions that they are desperately looking for relief for. The homeopathic industry not only lies to people and takes their money, it can even worsen public health by discouraging people from seeking help from proven, conventional medicine, guiding them towards homeopathy and other nonsensical alternative treatments instead. This is a true problem.


Lastly, I want to link you to a video about homeopathy made by a brilliant knowledge-spreading Youtube channel that some of you may have heard of: Kurzgesagt (In a nutshell). This video is what made me aware of the many flaws of homeopathy in the first place, and for that I'm endlessly thankful to the creators of it!

Essentially, homeopathy is based on the belief that **like cures like**. In practice, this would mean that different symptoms would be treated using small amounts of substances that in bigger doses would cause them.

I do acknowledge that this ""like cures like"" principle has been scientifically researched, with the name **hormesis**. Because of these studies, it's widely accepted that a small amount of a substance can in some cases have a different effect on a cell than a higher dose. However, we don't know how rare this phenomenon is, and the alternate effect it causes isn't necessarily positive or desired at all. 

Practicioners of homeopathy generalize this very unclear and controversial theory by thinking anything that causes a symptom can cure it in low doses. For example, in 2018, naturopath and homeopathic practicioner Anke Zimmermann gave a 4-year-old boy a remedy containing the saliva of a rabid dog, to treat the boy's supposed anger management issues (which, by the way, are perfectly natural for children that age), aggression and poor sleep, claiming that the solution ""cured"" him. If the remedy actually contained the virus, this woman was literally endangering a child's life for some crazy pseudoscientific experiment, while probably charging the parents a significant sum of money for it.

Additionally, there is another, arguably even bigger problem with homeopathy. Homeopathic medicine is produced using a method called ""potentization."" This means mixing 1 part of the desired ingredient with 9 parts of water, then shaking the solution, then mixing 1 part of the mixture with 9 parts of water again, and repeating this process over and over again. Homeopaths claim that the less of the ingredient the final solution contains, the more effective it is. This leads to the ingredients being diluted into nonexistence: in almost all homeopathic remedies, not a single molecule remains of the original ingredient. And even remedies that do have something else than water or alcohol in them only contain a couple of molecules of it: not enough to cause any effect. Again, none of this has been scientifically proven to work, but to be honest, homeopathic ""doctors"" don't seem to care about science anyway.

4853,"Three years ago, as an oncology volunteer, I got to know my patients quite well. One was particularly fond of long conversations. He enjoyed sharing his life stories and adventures. I volunteered almost everyday, and he, his roommate and I would spend hours sharing stories and jokes and sometimes singing. (It was all completely within the realm of what volunteers do in this program.)

Near the end of my stint, he gave me a handwritten note expressing his best wishes.

Limiting the information I write; but, he worked in an industry that suffered a major accident some years ago. His illness (and ultimate passing) were a delayed result of that accident. The note he gave me was written on a postcard from that industry, and he signed his name alongside the name of his specific company/workplace.

After a few months, I left the volunteer position.

Just recently, I found the card again and google-searched his name (it was impulsive; I understand now this was a HIPAA violation). I learned that he passed away. I was and still am devastated; he was a person with incredible integrity. I feel an impulse to grieve somehow -- I carry his card with me; I visited a memorial for his industry, and wandered around for hours, crying a little and remembering our time.

But I am afraid this is all inappropriate and boundary-crossing. I broke HIPAA by searching his name and learning information I was not entitled to (although.... if he gave me a signed card with his name, and I searched based on that information not information from the hospital, is that still HIPAA-breaking?).

**It also seems really inappropriate to visit the memorial or 'grieve' someone who I had a purely clinical relationship with.**

Am I correct that reading about a former patient online, carrying the card and visiting a memorial are inappropriate? Should I be backing off and/or addressing my own boundary issues with a psychologist to prevent future boundary-crossing?

Or, is it in fact acceptable and normal to 'grieve' a patient in this manner?

One more question: He really wanted me to meet his wife, and her to meet me, because she was so important to him and appeared in all his stories (and apparently enjoyed telling her about his volunteer as well). When she visited, he made a point of introducing us, and we all sat together and shared stories. I assume it would be inappropriate and/or HIPAA-non-compliant to contact his wife, share some memories, and extend my condolences?

I have also been tempted to walk by the company/workplace he signed in his note, just to see what it the place was like that meant so much to him. Would that be wrong as well?

4864,"I don't know how to feel about this. I recall an EM physician not too long ago posted a similar story so I wanted to share mine.

I'm in IM. I was doing some moonlighting one night when a lady comes in for hypertensive emergency. Her SBP is &gt;200 and she has a headache. All her other vital signs are rock solid. She has elevated trops and an elevated BNP. I trend the tropes out and first they are level, and then start dropping as we get control of her pressures with a nicardipine drip (slow early decrease, aimed for no less than 160 for the night). A CT head has no bleed. Not any other end organ damage. 

SpO2 98% on RA the whole time. HR comfortably in the 70s-80s, and she's on a baby dose of metop xl 25 at home. She was given an extra metop short-acting 25 in the ED for the HTN. 

Never any chest pain, SOB. Had a cough she reported in the morning without sputum, or hemoptysis. She did have some palpitations, that was it. She gives me this strange history of polyuria as well over the last 24 hrs, which she makes a point to emphasize. Telemetry was rock solid normal. An EKG was identical to one done a year ago. The patient herself looks awesome. Pleasant, interactive. Nothing to suggest anything more serious going on that what's been presented.

Her exam is totally normal except for a slightly elevated JVP that I got at maybe 8 CM, and a positive hepatojugular reflex. She doesn't have any CHF history and overall I would call her exam euvolemic to slightly dry, so I was at first thrown off by that finding but I couldn't put it together with anything else I was seeing. So in my mind I'm thinking, she's older, maybe there's just some pulmonary HTN or something. I'm going to let her drink to thirst and I see no reason to diurese. 

I see she has a history of thoracic descending aortic aneurysm, which was imaged about a month ago and stable but ever so slowly growing. She starts telling me she has left shoulder pain. Exacerbated by movement. I'm thinking: ok this is totally MSK pain. I pour over this for like 2-3 hours. HTN emerg. Descending aneurysm. Left shoulder pain. Trops. And the nurse is telling me she's been up all night back and forth urinating, producing small amounts but constantly doing it, consistent with the polyuria in the ROS. 

So I finally pull the trigger and CTA her, just to put my mind at ease about the aneurysm. I chalk the trops to a type II NSTEMI and rationalize that she is not having an ACS so I don't need to give her anticoagulation. 

A couple of times her BP drops to like normotensive levels suddenly, making the nicardipine stop. Then it gets restarted when it goes back up. I don't think much of this except to make sure she's not stroking out. It's already been much more than 6 hours since presentation so I don't get too worried about those drops.

I follow up the next day and -great- the aneurysm is stable. But BOOM PE in the right main pulmonary artery. Signs of right heart strain! Wtf!

It was just dumb luck. So now of course the right-sided heart findings on exam makes sense. But that's it. How utterly jarring and unnerving. I'm wondering if I missed this. Should I have acted on my exam? How the hell does this cause HTN emerg? Should I have started the AC on the type II NSTEMI?

I see she has a history of thoracic descending aortic aneurysm, which was imaged about a month ago and stable but ever so slowly growing. She starts telling me she has left shoulder pain. Exacerbated by movement. I'm thinking: ok this is totally MSK pain. I pour over this for like 2-3 hours. HTN emerg. Descending aneurysm. Left shoulder pain. Trops. And the nurse is telling me she's been up all night back and forth urinating, producing small amounts but constantly doing it, consistent with the polyuria in the ROS. 

So I finally pull the trigger and CTA her, just to put my mind at ease about the aneurysm. I chalk the trops to a type II NSTEMI and rationalize that she is not having an ACS so I don't need to give her anticoagulation. 

A couple of times her BP drops to like normotensive levels suddenly, making the nicardipine stop. Then it gets restarted when it goes back up. I don't think much of this except to make sure she's not stroking out. It's already been much more than 6 hours since presentation so I don't get too worried about those drops.

I follow up the next day and -great- the aneurysm is stable. But BOOM PE in the right main pulmonary artery. Signs of right heart strain! Wtf!

It was just dumb luck. So now of course the right-sided heart findings on exam makes sense. But that's it. How utterly jarring and unnerving. I'm wondering if I missed this. Should I have acted on my exam? How the hell does this cause HTN emerg? Should I have started the AC on the type II NSTEMI? I feel like this could have gone VERY badly and honestly it is terrifying.",Submassive (but huge) PE found by dumb luck,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/bmqdm7/submassive_but_huge_pe_found_by_dumb_luck/

4873,"I had a particularly unpleasant consult with an unwell child the other day and I would appreciate your opinions on it:

A mum brought her 3 year old boy to our family clinic the other day. I had never met either of them before. As they walked in I could see that the child appeared well (good color, no shortness of breath, walked in normally and sat down, said 'hi' and was smiling). Because of how well he seemed I relaxed.

Mum opens by saying that the kid has ""croup"" and needs prednisolone.

Ok I thought. What does the ""cough sound like?""

""It's a seal-like barking cough"", she states.

I thought that was a bit odd and that she must have heard it from a doctor at some point. I got the rest of the history from them. In summary he had a runny nose for a few days and then starting with a dry ""seal-like barking cough"" had started infrequently over the last 24 hours. No stridor or shortness of breath. No fevers and was eating and drinking well.

I then examined the child and apart from a runny nose everything was normal: Appears well, no stridor, good hydration, vitals normal including temperature, no meningism, ears and throat looked normal, chest clear. The only thing was a bit of a runny nose. I did not witness a single cough during the 20 minutes they were there.

I then spent about 15 minutes discussing about how I thought there was a *possibility* that this wasn't croup and that maybe she was interpreting a regular cough as a croupy cough. My plan was to treat this conservatively with rest, fluids and acetaminophen and have them return or go to emergency if he was starting to get worse - particularly if he developed shortness of breath/stridor. She didn't take this too well and in the end we agreed on a backpocket script for pred that she could take home and give him if he started to get worse.

The next day I received a formal complaint from her about me with all kinds of accusations like I was putting her child in harm's way by not giving the pred, not knowing what croup was, by seeming that I made her feel unwelcome that she was even there (in reality I was stunned at how she yelled at this kid to sit down when they arrived). During the consult she also punched the kid in the arm hard with a closed fist because he wriggled in his chair a bit (ADHD) - but that is not the topic of this post.

During my time writing a response to the complaint, I went back through all of the notes that we had on this child. In his 3 years of life he had been brought to our clinic almost 50 times with some variation of viral illnesses - runny noses, AOM, viral induced wheeze etc and had received approximately 20 courses of antibiotics. Looking through the notes I also found that the child has also been given **12** courses of prednisolone for croup. Every single instance was the same: mum brought in child saying he has a ""seal-like barking cough"", he looks completely well to the doctors, sometimes a mild non-croupy cough was heard but never any stridor and vitals and examination always normal except for sometimes a mild fever. However, each time he was prescribed prednisolone seemed to have been due to mum reporting a ""seal-like barking cough.""

She’s leaving soon for work a few hours away. I don’t really have friends yet. I haven’t started work because of my work permit still needing another 4-6 weeks for approval.

5247,"**TLDR:**  Mexico City is an amazing place, with a beautiful culture, good and cheap food, amazing art, and tons of things to do.  I recommend going for at least 4 days, but you could obviously spend weeks or months traveling there!  It made a great first solo trip for me, so get out and see it!

Thanks to many people in this sub, I went on my first solo trip a few weeks ago!  I’m back to give a review on my trip, in which I will start on some basics about my trip and then finish with a day-by-day outline in case someone wishes for more details.

**Context:**   I’m an American (20M) and went on a Saturday to Saturday trip to Mexico City in May.  Being young and having never travelled solo before, I was very apprehensive (especially after dealing with worrying feelings from friends/family).  I finished the semester of the university and had a week off before I started summer work, so I booked the cheapest international flight.

**Cost:** Mexico is super cheap relative to the U.S. (like $15/night for a hostel dorm bed, less than $5 for 3-5 tacos and a corona, etc.).  Airfare included, my trip cost ~$550.  I’d say I didn’t travel very frugally nor very expensively; I ate a lot of street food to save money, had average-priced accommodations, went to a lot of museums, but I never truly splurged on big nights out, fancy meals, special tours, etc.  I recommend uber and the metro for transportation as the most expensive uber ride I had was across the entire city for only $8 USD and metro fare is 5 pesos.

**Hostels:**  I loved the hostels I stayed at.  They were clean, the staff were accommodating, the locations were perfect.  In the first half of the week I stayed at Hostel Home in Roma.  This was a perfect neighborhood to get used to the city and traveling alone.  I felt safe everywhere I went, even at night, and there are tons of great places for food/nightlife.  The second half of the week I stayed in Suites DF, which is in the busier central part of the city.  It was a convenient location as far as walking to “touristy sites.”  The hostel was also larger and had a more social crowd.  People were social at hostel home in the sense that they wanted to do things with other people during the day, go out for dinner, etc., but most people went to bed around 10:00 PM every night.  The crowd at Suites DF were more independent during the day, but *everyone* lounged around in the evenings with lots of beer.  I had some of the best conversations I’ve ever had with the people at Suites DF.

*Day 0-* I landed and took a taxi to my hostel (I strongly recommend Uber instead).  I checked in around 11:30 PM, and right away there was a group going out to Mama Rumba which is a fantastic bar with live salsa music.  Drinks were particularly cheap and there was a ~130 pesos cover charge, but it was a surreal way to start my trip!

*Day 1-* The next day I went to centro historico and did the free walking tour (meets at 11 AM, can reserve online, look for people in pink shirts near the national cathedral in el zocalo).  This was a great way to start my first day, as the tour guides pointed out all of the important buildings.  After the tour, I went back to the National Palace (amazing murals by Diego Rivera), the National Cathedral, and National Art Museum (with my, personally, favorite art collection from the Academy of San Carlos).  Keep in mind most museums are free (and very crowded) on Sundays!  Check out coffee on the 8th story of the latinamerican tower for a great view of Bellas Artes!

*Day 2-* I went with another person from the hostel to Teotihuacan.  We took the metro to the bus station and then public buses to the pyramids (all for less than 120 pesos and about 1.5-2 hours of travel time).  The park is huge, so we spent most of the day there.  Wear hat, bring sunglasses, use lots of sunscreen, and drink plenty of water!!  After that, we took the bus back and got off a few stops early so that we could check out the Basilica of Guadalupe.  The buildings were beautiful, but I’d say that it was a little underwhelming.  

*Day 3-* I spent the day in Chapultepec park.  I went to the castle on top of the hill which is also a history museum.  The views and gardens at the top are amazing, and I highly recommend it!  After that I walked/ate my way to the modern art museum, where there is a small art collection (though I was primarily interested in just seeing Frida Kahlo’s The Two Fridas).  I’m not sure if the cost is worth what is there- unless you really like modern art.  I ended the day by going to the anthropology museum.  You could spend days here, but I was exhausted by this time and only spent about 3 hours.  In the evening, I went to Lucha Libre at Arena Mexico with some other travelers at the hostel.  I recommend going with a group for safety, and it definitely helps if at least a couple of you speak good Spanish.  We payed ~100 pesos to sit in the ~15th row, and it was such a great experience!  I had no clue what to expect, but everything about the night was entertaining- especially after a few drinks.  Be sure to go straight back to your hostel after the lucha because the neighborhood is known to be a little sketchy.

*Day 4-* This day I went to the neighborhood of Coyoacan.  This was my favorite part of Mexico City, and it came at the perfect time of my trip; by spending the previous three days in the busier areas of the city, I felt a much greater appreciation of the small neighborhood that I was in.  The two parks are beautiful, the church is beautiful, the artisan market is neat (though I expected more home-made crafts), and the Coyoacan market has great food options inside (check out the tortas in the center!).  I also ate fantastic churros and had the best coffee of the trip in this neighborhood (Café Avellaneda, Café Negro).  By this day I was pretty tired of museums, so I opted out of going to the Frida Kahlo museum; however, it was still a fun stroll through the streets to get to the museum itself, which passes a city park/soccer field and many food places.  You can definitely spend at least half a day in Coyoacan.
	After spending the morning/early afternoon in Coyoacan, I had to switch hostels to Hostel Suites DF near the city center.  Having a hostel downtown is definitely a different pace than in a neighborhood like Roma (more on this at the end).  After checking into my hostel, I went to Museo Mural Diego Rivera where there is a reclaimed famous (and my favorite) mural by the Mexican artist- it is a small museum, but I highly recommend spending 20-30 minutes there!  You can then exit the museum and be in the park where the mural is set!  After this I got some conchas and other pastries from a 90+ year old bakery called Pasteleria Ideal.  Pro tip: instead of paying ~150 pesos to go to the ~42nd floor of the observation deck in the latinamerican tower, go to the 40th floor for a 130 peso margarita for a view AND a drink!

*Day 5-* I started this day by walking to bilbioteca vasconselos, which is a very cool public library.  It was a bit confusing to get the right “permission” for taking photos, but in the end I got some great shots.  After that, I ubered to to Polanco, which is a wealthy area of the city.  I was kind of unsure of how to spend my time here, so I would advise having a better plan of things to do.  I did check out the Soumaya Museum, which is a free private museum.  It is very cool building and has a good collection.  I spent the remainder of the day visiting with people at the hostel and eating a ton of food.

*Day 6-* My final day here, I walked down the avenue of the reform, starting at the monument of the revolution.  This was a long walk with not a ton to see along the way besides the monuments every few blocks, but it was definitely a different feel than other areas of the downtown.  I then spent the rest of the day doing a little bit of shopping, eat tons of food, and visiting with people at the hostel.

I checked in around 11:30 PM, and right away there was a group going out to Mama Rumba which is a fantastic bar with live salsa music.  Drinks were particularly cheap and there was a ~130 pesos cover charge, but it was a surreal way to start my trip!

*Day 1-* The next day I went to centro historico and did the free walking tour (meets at 11 AM, can reserve online, look for people in pink shirts near the national cathedral in el zocalo).  This was a great way to start my first day, as the tour guides pointed out all of the important buildings.  After the tour, I went back to the National Palace (amazing murals by Diego Rivera), the National Cathedral, and National Art Museum (with my, personally, favorite art collection from the Academy of San Carlos).  Keep in mind most museums are free (and very crowded) on Sundays!  Check out coffee on the 8th story of the latinamerican tower for a great view of Bellas Artes!

*Day 2-* I went with another person from the hostel to Teotihuacan.  We took the metro to the bus station and then public buses to the pyramids (all for less than 120 pesos and about 1.5-2 hours of travel time).  The park is huge, so we spent most of the day there.  Wear hat, bring sunglasses, use lots of sunscreen, and drink plenty of water!!  After that, we took the bus back and got off a few stops early so that we could check out the Basilica of Guadalupe.  The buildings were beautiful, but I’d say that it was a little underwhelming.  

*Day 3-* I spent the day in Chapultepec park.  I went to the castle on top of the hill which is also a history museum.  The views and gardens at the top are amazing, and I highly recommend it!  After that I walked/ate my way to the modern art museum, where there is a small art collection (though I was primarily interested in just seeing Frida Kahlo’s The Two Fridas).  I’m not sure if the cost is worth what is there- unless you really like modern art.  I ended the day by going to the anthropology museum.  You could spend days here, but I was exhausted by this time and only spent about 3 hours.  In the evening, I went to Lucha Libre at Arena Mexico with some other travelers at the hostel.  I recommend going with a group for safety, and it definitely helps if at least a couple of you speak good Spanish.  We payed ~100 pesos to sit in the ~15th row, and it was such a great experience!  I had no clue what to expect, but everything about the night was entertaining- especially after a few drinks.  Be sure to go straight back to your hostel after the lucha because the neighborhood is known to be a little sketchy.

*Day 4-* This day I went to the neighborhood of Coyoacan.  This was my favorite part of Mexico City, and it came at the perfect time of my trip; by spending the previous three days in the busier areas of the city, I felt a much greater appreciation of the small neighborhood that I was in.  The two parks are beautiful, the church is beautiful, the artisan market is neat (though I expected more home-made crafts), and the Coyoacan market has great food options inside (check out the tortas in the center!).  I also ate fantastic churros and had the best coffee of the trip in this neighborhood (Café Avellaneda, Café Negro).  By this day I was pretty tired of museums, so I opted out of going to the Frida Kahlo museum; however, it was still a fun stroll through the streets to get to the museum itself, which passes a city park/soccer field and many food places.  You can definitely spend at least half a day in Coyoacan.
	After spending the morning/early afternoon in Coyoacan, I had to switch hostels to Hostel Suites DF near the city center.  Having a hostel downtown is definitely a different pace than in a neighborhood like Roma (more on this at the end).  After checking into my hostel, I went to Museo Mural Diego Rivera where there is a reclaimed famous (and my favorite) mural by the Mexican artist- it is a small museum, but I highly recommend spending 20-30 minutes there!  You can then exit the museum and be in the park where the mural is set!  After this I got some conchas and other pastries from a 90+ year old bakery called Pasteleria Ideal.  Pro tip: instead of paying ~150 pesos to go to the ~42nd floor of the observation deck in the latinamerican tower, go to the 40th floor for a 130 peso margarita for a view AND a drink!

*Day 5-* I started this day by walking to bilbioteca vasconselos, which is a very cool public library.  It was a bit confusing to get the right “permission” for taking photos, but in the end I got some great shots.  After that, I ubered to to Polanco, which is a wealthy area of the city.  I was kind of unsure of how to spend my time here, so I would advise having a better plan of things to do.  I did check out the Soumaya Museum, which is a free private museum.  It is very cool building and has a good collection.  I spent the remainder of the day visiting with people at the hostel and eating a ton of food.

*Day 6-* My final day here, I walked down the avenue of the reform, starting at the monument of the revolution.  This was a long walk with not a ton to see along the way besides the monuments every few blocks, but it was definitely a different feel than other areas of the downtown.  I then spent the rest of the day doing a little bit of shopping, eat tons of food, and visiting with people at the hostel.

5250,"Hey! So back in November I [24F] moved to Chicago by myself, not knowing a single soul. Over the past 7 months I’ve realized that I haven’t been having the right approach to this new phase of my life.

I’ve gone on several solo trips (both international and in the US) and I’ve noticed that when I’m on these trips I’m almost a different person. I’m naturally more of an introvert but when I go on solo-trips I’m forced to be more social and outgoing. 

Well, this past week I was feeling kind of down because I was worried that I wasn’t where I was supposed to be socially after living somewhere for 7 months. After all, it’s somewhat hard to make connections/friends when you’re starting from scratch! 

Yesterday I had an epiphany of sorts! I realized that I was not treating this move the same way I’ve treated past solo-trips. I was being very passive in a lot of ways and waiting for opportunities to jump in my lap— the complete opposite of how I am when traveling.

SO, yesterday I went to a rooftop bar by myself. At first I felt super awkward but then I asked myself “What would you do if this was just a solo-trip and you were exploring this city by yourself?” 

I ended up approaching a group of girls that I thought looked really nice and I said to them “ Hey! I recently moved here and am trying to ‘mingle’. Nice to meet you!” 

Haha I know that sounds cheesy but IT WORKED. I ended up spending the whole night with these girls and we went to a pizza place and another bar and I got their contact info! 

My point of writing all of this is to say— traveling solo has helped me in many many ways and it has made this phase of my life (living  in a new city by myself) a little easier.   I recently decided to treat my solo-move to a big city as if it were one large solo-vacay! This mentality has already helped me out so much!",t5_2rxxm,travel,"Hey!

5253,"I’m currently away on my first solo trip to Sydney, Australia for a week from the States. I’ve begun to enjoy everything that comes with solo traveling - doing things independently, exploring whenever I want to, and being comfortable with myself. Even though I’m only halfway into this trip, I’ve felt as if I’ve learned more about myself these past few days than I’ve had for the past few years. 

My trip so far has been almost perfect. Too perfect if I must say so myself. I always get suspicious when things go too well, like karma is about to catch me around the corner. I got to go to Bondi to do the walk and ferries to Manly. I got to see the Opera House and the Harbor lit up in many different colors thanks to Vivid Sydney. I met new people at hostel that took on the town with me. Pretty much everything I wanted to do here, I’ve done it.

Everything was “perfect” until a couple hours ago when I sprained my ankle up in the Blue Mountains; it took me a $250 taxi ride and lots of lip biting to get me back into Sydney. But for some odd reason, I don’t feel so upset about it like I thought I’d typically be. Despite the pain, missing out on meeting up with a dinner date for the night, being out a sizable chunk of change and stuck in a hostel bed, I’m actually quite content with myself. 

I was able to experience so many cool experiences before this incident, that I’m actually excited to check out things I can still do in town while I’m nursing myself back to health. It’s a strangely placed sense of optimism and independence that I think only came the last few days. Previously, I would get down and think of myself as an idiot, wondering how much better this trip would be had I just stepped straight - but no. I’m feeling excited to tackle this as a kink in the road, and I have solo traveling to thank for allowing me to not only gain a sense of independence, but to not sweat the small mishaps when they inevitably come up.

I (21F) ended my exchange programme at Delaware a week ago (I'm from Asia). I flew to Arizona and had a great time the past week. Then, I took a Greyhound bus to LA. 

At the Greyhound bus station, it showed that my bus would be 2h+ late. So I just sighed and continued to wait. When the time came around, my bus number just disappeared from the screen. I approached the customer service and was told that the screen isn't accurate and my bus had left and I probably did not hear them call my bus number. So I had to pay an extra $20 to catch another bus 3h+ later. 

Thus, I reached LA 6h later than planned. I quickly grabbed lunch, got a rental car and drove to a hostel I booked near Yosemite. Google maps led me to a one-way off-road which had a dead end. I had no choice but to reverse my car to the main road. By this time, it was already close to 11pm and it was dark as heck. Unfortunately, I reversed my car into a ditch. 

I was scared as heck, ran out of the car with my phone (which had no line) and looked for help. To keep the story short, a tow truck came the next afternoon and got my car out. However, the car is dented and I most likely would have to pay $1000 to the rental company. 

I just don't know what to do. I spent the last 2 days in the hostel, not even going out to explore Yosemite. Today is Memorial Day here and I'm not sure if I can get the car fixed before returning it tomorrow.

I’ve really enjoyed seeing Muay Thai matches and the beaches down in Ao Nang, but I’ve also been moody and feeling vaguely sick this whole last week.

5261,"I mean that feeling that you could live out your days in a town or village.

I'm currently in Portugal, in a tiny town right on the border with Spain.  I originally only planned to stay in the hostel for a couple of days.....

Three weeks later I'm still here.  I've met everybody and I literally mean EVERYONE in town.  This place feels like heaven: the weather is good, food and drink are very cheap, the food is FRESH and plentiful and most importantly the people.  The people here are the absolute nicest folks I've ever met in my entire life.  Everybody is calm, decent, lovely and so wonderful.  I've been welcomed with open arms and people are so excited to see me wherever I am.  Be it the cafe, Mercado, walking the streets or just a wave as we pass each other.

Life here is something that I've dreamed about: it's half pace, slow and while people still work they do it with a focus on happieness.  I think about life back home in Canada, with the shit weather, godawful pace of life and most importantly the cost.

Now I know, even with the CAD to EUR exchange rate I'm losing money.  However the cost of goods here is easily 1/5 what it is back home! I've spent less than one fifth of what is spend just to survive in the great White North.

I also understand reality: I'm not an EU citizen and I only get 90 days in a 180 day period in the Schengen zone.  I'd need to marry and probably buy property to start the grueling process of moving here.  Not to mention a job.  My industry is in demand here but still, it's not like visas are an overnight thing.

I also understand I'm in the honeymoon phase, with rose tinted glasses.  I'm not living here and don't know the in and out of day to day life here.  Most Portuguese make about 1/5 what I make back home - hence the extremely cheap costs of goods.  I come from an advanced first world safe country with abundant natural resources, extremely high wages and a high standard of living.

Also Portuguese is hard, man.  While I'm fluent en Espanol, Portuguese es muy difícil!! It would probably take months or even years to master.

But still, I've been to more than 2 dozen countries and this place pulls at my heart strings so hard it hurts.  I'm definitely going to be bawling my eyes out when I leave.

But I was a targeted victim as they had seen me with my belongings out the previous night.

Got back this morning from 10 days in Iceland, my first solo trip, and it was great (mostly)!

Here are just a few pics. 
http://imgur.com/a/UYgnmkb

My plan was to 'ball on a budget' because of how expensive Iceland allegedly (and actually) is. I'll break down some elements of the trip below!

**Sleeping:** My plan was to camp most days and Airbnb at the start and end of the trip. This ended up backfiring because my tent was shite, and it was cold and windy for it. I ended up sleeping in my tiny car most days and getting more Airbnbs than planned.

**Food:** So here's where I just got silly. I brought most of my stuff (PB, jerkey, canned chicken, Clif/Kind bars) but bought a few things (Jelly, bread, ham). This is literally what I ate everyday. To say malnourished is putting it lightly. One day I judt bought canned peas and carrots and ate that. By the end of the trip my stomach was not having it haha. But I really wanted to save money and I was just bumming it, so I didn't mind so much. Food is REAL expensive over there and I only ate out maybe twice? Akureyri Fish and Chips was great, highly recommend. 

**Activities:** I did the entire ring road (counter clockwise), and the peninsula. I was moving pretty quickly but I did a LOT of stuff. The last few days really sucked because there wasn't a lot to do in the North activity wise. It's like a wasteland up there. Not a fun time, so I just blazed through it. Day to day I did some variation of hiking. One day I got caught up and accidentally went on a crazy treacherous 3 hour hike. That was enough for me, haha.

**People:** Like they say everyone speaks English there, even fellow tourists! It was awesome being able to hear about other people's adventures. If you do the ring road there's a chance you'll see the same people MULTIPLE times. I ended up running into these two friends so often that we ended up spending a day together, really great!

**Money:** Didn't use cash once. You probably should take out some to use restrooms in gas stations if they charge (like 200Kr.) but everyone and their mother takes cards. Pretty cool. Stuff over there is also really expensive. Not cool. Getting a burger and fries anywhere was like $18 USD. I never did that business, but to each their own.

**Sights:** The waterfalls! I thought I might get tired of them but wow. Each one has its own personality and unique touch. It's also amazing how hugeee everything is. Makes you feel so small! 

**Other:** 

* Skyr is overrated, it's just Greek yogurt. Skip on that. I'm a candy guy, so I tried lots of candy if I could. [This stuff is devine](https://i.imgur.com/h4xIKYg.jpg). Buy this. It's like chewy chocolate with licorice in it. They love their licorice.
* Don't turn on red. Also don't speed. There are only cameras near Reykjavik and in the tunnels, but it's not worth it to risk it.
* Get a sim card at the little shop in the airport near the exit. It was like $30 for 10 Gee Bees of data and it was plenty. No text/talk though except for domestic.

I don't write here often so bear with me please.

A couple of weeks ago I was in a hostel in Osaka. We were chilling in the common area when guy said that he snores when he sleeps and he's been told that his snoring is too loud so he bought us some earplugs and apologized in advance.

In my opinion this definitely the thoughtful and nicest thing I've seen during my trip there because I don't he has to do it neither apologize for it. Honestly I was overwhelmed that and I totally appreciate what he did.   A snoring gyu with the nicest gesture",t5_2rxxm,travel,"Hello friends,

I was considering the possibility of him being homeless, or maybe he is has some mental issues

5273,"Hey y'all! I'm Alex, a 28-year-old American solo female traveler and the creative brain behind [Lost With Purpose travel blog](https://www.lostwithpurpose.com/).

For the last three+ years I've been backpacking full time, often roaming through countries people warned me to be well wary of such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. People often think I'm either A) crazy or B) a member of ISIS but I assure you only A is true. These days, I live primarily off of my travel blog's income, and occasionally supplement it with freelance work.

In the last three years I traveled through (in order):

* Georgia (3 weeks)
* Armenia (3 weeks)
* Iran (2 months)
* Pakistan (8 months by now? Over 5 visits.)
* Western China (3 weeks)
* Kazakhstan (2 weeks)
* Kyrgyzstan (3 weeks)
* Uzbekistan (3 weeks)
* Afghanistan (3 weeks)
* India (Man who knows... 1+ year over a few visits)
* Nepal (1 month)
* Bhutan (3 weeks)
* Bangladesh (6 weeks)
* Bits here and there in Brazil, Colombia, and Belgium

The whole world calls to me, but I have a special place in my heart (and passport) for South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan where together I've spent more than a year and a half in total.

During the last few years I've scaled ancient fortresses, seen gods dance, and road tripped across deserts. Overland travel is my MO; I've taken every kind of public transport under the sun from camping on floors of ferries to hitching rides with army convoys. While traveling I've gone through a breakup (I began my years of travel with a boyfriend), lost family and friends, and fell in love when I least wanted it. I've eaten a million different kinds of street food by now, and had about as many bouts of diarrhea (I find it strangely satisfying at this point). I braved gynecological adventures in patriarchal India, and was saved from a foul and watery doom in a clinic in Afghanistan. Just last year I learned to motorbike in the chaotic traffic of Pakistan, and worked a photography assignment with an NGO doing medical work with refugees in Thailand. Let's just say I've been around the block.

At this point, I love to share about my travels in the hopes of inspiring and helping others to travel, as well as smashing stereotypes about the countries I visit. Oh, and of course it's always fun to prove that girls can get to some crazy places in this world, too.

Proof is [my blog](https://www.lostwithpurpose.com)/[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lostwithpurpose)/whatever and also picture of me lurking in the darkness of an office of a creepy man in a village in Pakistan who's been trying to pick me up because passport (but I'm dealing with his Whatsapp advances so I can use his office to access the interwebs).

Get at me with your questions! No thought is too silly, no inquiry too freaky, and I love talking about poop so no worries there.

Hello all. Last week I ripped my passport by trying to copy it (ironically in case something happened to my passport). I posted a pic my passport last week and the majority of you told me it wouldn’t fly. You guys were right, as confirmed by the passport agency. Especially because it has been through so much already (26 countries!).


Here is what to do if you are a US citizen and something happens to your passport before your trip.

Depending on the amount of time until your trip, there’s different protocols. I have personally know someone who has gotten their passport in 2 hours. See the breakdown here:

https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/apply-renew-passport/hurry.html

I had about 9 days until my flight. First you make an appointment with the nearest passport agency. The list of them is available through the link above. I was lucky that the nearest was 1 hour away.

They ask you before anything else when your flight is. They process your passport depending on how soon you will be traveling. So I made an appointment for Friday at 7:00am. 

It is very important that you have every single thing they ask for. I’m not going to tell you what you need, because there are different situations. 

What I needed was:
- the appointment confirmation number
- Proof of travel (I printed my ticket and hostel confirmation)
- Old passport (you may need birth certificate, please read carefully on the site what you need)
- Full application that I was able to fill out digitally and print already competed.
- Copy of my drivers license front and back.
- Passport photos


I got to the agency at 6:30am and there was already a line of people with the same appointment time as me. GET THERE EARLY.

The line and security check took approximately 30 minutes. I was out of there by 8am. They gave me a receipt to pick up my passport one day before my flight.

I picked it up today. Boy what a  week this was. But off we go.
I’m off to my flight today.
Have a nice trip everyone.   UPDATE: I ripped my passport one week before my trip. I picked it up yesterday, flying out today. Here is what to do for US citizens.",t5_2rxxm,travel,"

I wanted to see some of the archaeological sites in Greece and it suddenly struck me that there was nothing stopping me. I have no SO, no kids and a fair amount of savings. If anyone can just get up and go, it’s me. 

I get bad anxiety and if I had planned a holiday by myself in advance, there’s a good chance I would have chickened out and not gone.

I was nervous, but I didn’t focus on it. I landed in Heraklion and walked to a car rental shop just outside the airport.

5283,"Dear solo travelers, 

I'm a 23 year old male from Germany and thought I would share my experience of my first home sickness attack on my first solo trip. 

I started solo traveling about 2 years ago, so Im kind of a newbie, only have been to Portugal, Morocco, Denmark and Turkey alone. I really enjoy it and see the benefits over traveling as a couple, with a friend or as a group. 

I never thought that home sickness will be a thing when I decided to travel solo. My first trip has been to Portugal (only 1 week unfortunately). I was really excited, and couldn't wait until the day of my departure finally arrived. The first feeling when you are alone inside an airport and go into that plane is kind of strange, but a cool experience indeed imo. 

Anyways, my first city were Faro. I checked in late in a hostel in the center of the city. All went well I really enjoyed doing what I want to do and not to take a friends or partners plans into consideration. After 2 days I left Faro towards Lisbon. And this is were it begun. Since I left the train in Lisbon a strange feeling came into my mind, something I never had before. Suddenly, I was thinking about my family and friends at home and it kind of made me sad. I arrived at my AirBnB room but couldn't check in yet, so I left my backpack there and thought I will explore the neighbourhood a bit. The feeling which started at the train station became stronger and stronger second by second. 

Nearby the place I was staying at, there was a stone staircase and I sat there to eat something. This was the point where I suddenly got a shutdown. Tears went out of my eyes and I was sitting there and thought ""what the hell are you doing here I want to go back home"". It was a crazy experience. After 2 Minutes I felt better and after this home sickness attack all went well and I never felt it this hard again on any of my solo trips. I think some home sickness is normal for every traveler. 

So, that was my experience from my first solo trip ever. Do you have any other similar experiences with home sickness? I am curios :-)

After 2 Minutes I felt better and after this home sickness attack all went well and I never felt it this hard again on any of my solo trips. I think some home sickness is normal for every traveler. 

So, that was my experience from my first solo trip ever. Do you have any other similar experiences with home sickness? I am curios :-)

5288,"Hi! 

All of last year I worked a pretty tedious job, but managed to save up a nice sum of money with the intention of long-term / indefinite travel in mind. 

I quit my job in March, packed all my stuff up, said goodbye to my friends and took a flight to South East Asia.

I spent the first month in Thailand with the intention of going to Vietnam for a few months to work and explore, as well as visit Laos, Cambodia and potentially India/Nepal. 

Unfortunately I never made it out of Thailand and am currently on a business class trip back to Australia. I fell awkwardly while hiking in Pai, Northern Thailand and ended up fracturing my fibula bone in my left leg. The doctor in Pai said I’d be able to walk again in two weeks... although that claim seemed a bit optimistic. 

Desperately hoping I wouldn’t have to go home, I took a pretty gruelling trip back to Chiang Mai (with a broken leg), visited another doctor and was told that I’d be good to walk in around 4 weeks. I spent about a week in a hostel with a broken leg, feeling kind of shitty because I had to stay in the hostel while everyone would go out and do activities / explore.

My insurance company wrote to me that they require me to seek medical advise in Australia and pretty much ordered me to come home immediately. 

Long story short: I plan to recover in Australia for a month and then get my ass back over to South East Asia to continue the trip. 

It just sucks that this inconvenience has cost me some time and a pretty sum of money $$.

Has anyone else had any solo travel horror stories?

5289,"Hi all,

Next year i'll most likely be finished with my studies. After i'm finished i'll finally have some free time to spend. 

So i thought about doing something that i have always wanted to do which is to do a solotrip to Japan. 

But it has recently came to my attention that the 2020 Olympics are being held in Tokyo next year.

My question is then whether or not i should still travel to Japan next year? 

If i understood it correctly, things will become very expensive and crowded during the Olympics. 

How bad do you all think it will be? Especially if you look at how things have been in the previous Olympics in other countries? 

Can i come to Japan maybe 1-2 months after the Olympics and be safe or should i avoid going there altogether during 2020?

Or will perhaps not whole Japan will be affected by the Olympics? I'm thinking about cities like Osaka and Kyoto which are quite separated from Tokyo. 

My goal with the trip is to explore the country and it's culture, i'll be visiting multiple regions and cities, so my stay in Tokyo will be limited.

I can't travel during winter or spring because of studies so summer or autumn will be my best bet. And if i don't travel next year i'll most likely have to postpone it even longer as i'll have to advance to university studies sooner or later.

5293,"Hey guys! Since Belarus just introduced [limited visa-free travel for many nationalities](http://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/visafreetravel/e0ced19bb1f9bf2c.html) in 2017 (loosened further in 2018), I've had a lot of interest from others in my recent experience there and thought I would share for anyone else thinking of taking advantage of the new visa-free regime.

**Background:** 27F Canadian, lots of previous experience travelling in eastern Europe. I can read cyrillic but don't speak any Russian beyond the basics (hello, goodbye, please, thank you etc). Trip took place in early January 2019.

**Budget:** Just under €200, not including airfare. Since visa-free travel only applies if you fly in and out of Minsk airport, airfare was the most expensive cost element (€ 67 Kiev to Minsk with Belavia, € 137 Minsk to Berlin with Air Baltic). Minsk was slightly more expensive than I expected, but still ""cheap"" (under Polish/Baltic price levels, but above Ukraine price levels). USD is more commonly accepted than EUR as an alternative currency, which surprised me.

**Length of Travel:** 4 days. Belarus was the last stop for me on a larger trip to Poland/Ukraine.

**Destination(s):** Minsk, day trips to the Stalin Line as well as the castles at Mir and Nesvizh

**Accommodation:** Trinity Hostel, 3 nights. Highly recommended. Helpful/bilingual staff, nice common area, organised tours/activities for guests. Most guests (80%+) at the time were Russian, but I think it's because I was there over Orthodox Christmas.

**Arrival:** Belarus offers [visa-free entry to 74 nationalities](http://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/visafreetravel/e0ced19bb1f9bf2c.html) for up to 30 days *if you fly in and out of Minsk airport*, and if you can prove adequate insurance and 'financial means' (about €20 per day). I had no idea what the procedure would be like and was worried because I was arriving late (9pm in winter), but everything went smoothly. There were insurance counters right before passport control, open at all hours, where they sold the necessary insurance for about €1 per day. Payment was possible by cash (EUR/USD) or card. I had brought the required financial means with me in EUR cash but they did not ask to see it. There was a public bus (every 30min) that took me to the nearest metro station, but I had to withdraw Belarusian rubles from an airport ATM to pay for it.

**Activities:**

* Walking around Minsk itself was awesome; it's still the Soviet city *par excellence*. Soviet architecture, Lenin statues, hammer and sickles, red stars everywhere. Visually, it's like the Cold War never ended.

* In Minsk: Museum of the Great Patriotic War. Excellent museum on WWII from the Soviet perspective, which is very distinct from the Western perspective I was used to. Exhibits were excellent quality and there was full English signage throughout.

* Daytrip to the [Stalin Line](https://www.tripadvisor.de/Attraction_Review-g3799346-d2650941-Reviews-The_Historical_and_Cultural_Complex_Stalin_Line-Loshany_Minsk_Region.html) in the countryside outside Minsk. WOW. The wildest part of this trip by far and a real once-in-a-lifetime experience as a history buff. This place is best described as a Cold War military fun park for the whole family. There is a shooting range (with weapons ranging from handguns/AKs to machine guns to anti-tank artillery), a tank driving range, reconstructed WWI trenches, underground WWII bunkers, endless rows of decommissioned tanks, artillery units, military aircraft and missiles, a kid's playground and a beer garden. It must be seen to be believed (pics below).

* Daytrip to the castles at Mir and Nesvizh. Organised tour by my hostel for 25 USD per person (not including tickets or food); totally worth it. Mir has the nicer *exterior* and is the more famous of the two, but Nesvizh had a *way* larger and more interesting interior. Ideally do a tour with both, but if you can only do one, choose Nesvizh. Easily on my list of top 3 castles.

**What Went Right:** Basically everything. Visa-free entry was smooth, hostel was great, no issues with ATMs or card payment, locals were super friendly. Minsk is clearly making a big push for tourism and now has good English/Latin character signage around the city centre, English announcements on the metro, and English signs at major museums and attractions. I heard from a fellow hostel guest that English/Latin signage was basically non-existent in Minsk as late as Dec 2017, so it is changing fast.

**What Went Wrong:** Not ""wrong"", but even though English signage is plentiful *(in the city centre)*, actual English language skills are not. Basic Russian phrases and the ability to read cyrillic are IMO still a must here, *especially* if you have any plans to leave the Minsk city centre (e.g. to visit the Stalin Line, castles, or other towns). I got by okay with basic language skills but certainly felt limited sometimes.

**Recommendations:** GO TO BELARUS!

**Final Verdict:** Minsk was a fun and unique destination, and I 100% plan to return to Belarus to see more of the country (supposedly you can go visa-free for 72 hours to the Brest region from the Polish land border!). There was a bit of culture shock (small children firing anti-tank artillery at the Stalin Line, militaristic/patriotic posters around the city) but to me it just made the experience that much more interesting/worthwhile.

I used to feel at home in hostels, hell I spent months living in them every year. Now I feel like I've ""aged"" out of them a bit. I'm tired of the transient friends you connect with super well and then never see them again. But I don't know how to make real friends.

The funnest time I had was riding a motorcycle in the north of Vietnam, hardly seeing anyone and being surrounded by mountains and just the feeling of being away from the city and big roads was amazing. I also discovered I am not a fan of the ""backpacking"" vibe, I dont really mind staying at hostels and I met and travelled with lots of cool people but it just got so old to me so fast, I dont want to sound like a dick but it just felt like meeting the same type of person over and over again (20-30 party hard people) while talking about the same things eg talking about travelling.

5304,"**Background:** 24 year old female Canadian. I have a general interest in the region, work with a fair amount of Kurdish refugees at home, and had some vacation days to use or lose. It was a last minute trip, so I just took it as an opportunity to learn more about the culture and understand day-to-day life in the region.   


**Length of Stay:** 9 days, March 2019. 

  
**Visa:** As a Canadian, I was able to get a VOA. I've seen some reports for 15 days, but mine was valid for 30 days. 

  
**Destinations:** Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, Dukan Lake, Akre, Shaqlawa, Soran/Rawanduz area. By shared taxi and rides with locals. Unfortunately, I didn't end up making it west to Dohuk or Lalish, but I heard fantastic things.   


**Budget:** Not including flights, approximately $300-350 CAD. Definitely bring more USD cash than you think you'll need though. It is perfectly safe to carry around and petty crime is very, very low. Currency exchange happens casually and openly on the street. The hassle of trying to find an ATM isn't worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Accommodations:** A mix of couch-surfing and hotels. The owner of Dolphin Hotel in Sulay is a super kind dude who's traveled to 70+ countries on his Iraqi passport, which is no easy feat. He really cares about his guests, the tourism prospects in Iraq, and he will go out of his way to help you. This is the closest place to a hostel you'll find. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Recommendations:** Meet and chat (or try to chat, haha) with the locals. The language barrier is intense - take it in stride. Eat good (cheap!) food. Visit the Amna Suraka Museum in Sulay. Wander around the citadel in Erbil. If you're a drinker, the German Beer Garden in Ankawa is a really fun place to meet both locals and foreigners. Get lost in the bazaars. Go to the countryside for a picnic - a very popular Kurdish activity. Be open and interested in what people want to share with you, whether it's a cup of tea, a story, or a place. 

  
**What Went Wrong:** The weather was pretty miserable. It rained at some point every single day that I was there. It initially threw my outdoor/nature-centred itinerary for a loop. But it was a good reminder that nothing is guaranteed, especially weather, and it's important to stay flexible while traveling. On the plus side, things were extra green!  


**What Went Right:** The nature is even more beautiful than you expect. The history is fascinating. The lack of tourists, and tourism infrastructure in general, made it both challenging and really rewarding. In a lot of ways, it felt like the most authentic travel experience I've ever had. Like someone else on here mentioned, I never felt taken advantage of for being a tourist. It's also a very diverse region, so I was able to meet a wide variety of people (Iraqi Kurds, Syrian Kurds, Arabs from the south, some expats, etc.) The people are the absolute highlight - friendly and welcoming. Even though Kurdistan is not representative of the rest of Iraq, I still felt like I was able to gain more perspective on the whole country.

&amp;#x200B;

**Traveling Solo as a Female in Iraqi Kurdistan:** I can't predict or speak to anyone else's experiences, but I never felt unsafe by myself. However, it's unlikely that you'll meet many other travellers, if any. You have to be willing to meet local people. The women I did meet were lovely, but the overwhelming majority of people I spent time with were men. The overwhelming majority of people on couch-surfing are also men. There were many times where I was the only woman in eyesight, including hours spent in shared taxis with multiple men who did not speak any English. This is a reality and it is something that you have to consider and be comfortable with. Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to plan in advance, but I'm sure it'd be possible to connect with some local women beforehand - or find other ways to meet locals besides couch-surfing.   


I also did not find Kurdish hospitality to be as in-your-face as some people proclaim. I attributed this partly to the shitty weather (less people, including myself, were just leisurely walking around the streets), partly to the language barrier, and partly to being a woman on my own. Locals are much more cautious of randomly approaching a solo female foreigner than a solo male foreigner. Once I started making friends, however, the Kurdish warmth absolutely shone through.   


**Overall Verdict:** A very special trip - definitely worth visiting for those who have personal ties or interest in the region. You are guaranteed to leave with amazing friends, unique memories, and a new understanding of Iraq/Kurdistan.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Important Note:** I really, genuinely loved my experience - it helped shatter so many of my own personal biases. However, I would not recommend Iraqi Kurdistan to anyone new to solo travel or new to more ""challenging"" places.   


Of the three other travellers I met, two of them were full-time vloggers going ""off the beaten path"" as part of their job (nice people - but a very bizarre experience to randomly meet them). I'd hope that someone wouldn't travel to Iraq blindly, but in the age of social media, sometimes these documented highlights can gloss over genuine challenges and safety concerns that the average traveler will face. People can quickly jump to a place because someone on Instagram posted a nice picture of it. Yes, this part of Iraq is filled with beautiful nature, wonderful people, and a surprising sense of stability and safety. I think that reality deserves to be promoted, so that we can fight negative stereotypes and inaccurate Western portrayals (which is partly why I'm writing this). But at the end of the day, Iraqi Kurdistan is still Iraq. Iraq is still Iraq, and while there's an increasing number of people vouching for its tourism potential (myself included), it's important to be realistic about your experience and the context on the ground.   


Have at least a basic understanding of the politics embedded within a new place. Be cautious, alert, and aware that things can change quickly. Have a plan for what will happen if they do. Be mindful of the diversity of local people. Don't expect a backpacking culture. Take the necessary precautions (buy high-risk travel insurance, figure out where the closest embassy is, etc.). Don't be a moron, basically. I know I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but the last thing I'd want is someone reading a trip report, being inspired to go somewhere, and then going.. ""oh fuck, I'm not prepared for this"" AFTER the fact.

But it was a good reminder that nothing is guaranteed, especially weather, and it's important to stay flexible while traveling. On the plus side, things were extra green!  


**What Went Right:** The nature is even more beautiful than you expect. The history is fascinating. The lack of tourists, and tourism infrastructure in general, made it both challenging and really rewarding. In a lot of ways, it felt like the most authentic travel experience I've ever had. Like someone else on here mentioned, I never felt taken advantage of for being a tourist. It's also a very diverse region, so I was able to meet a wide variety of people (Iraqi Kurds, Syrian Kurds, Arabs from the south, some expats, etc.) The people are the absolute highlight - friendly and welcoming. Even though Kurdistan is not representative of the rest of Iraq, I still felt like I was able to gain more perspective on the whole country.

&amp;#x200B;

**Traveling Solo as a Female in Iraqi Kurdistan:** I can't predict or speak to anyone else's experiences, but I never felt unsafe by myself. However, it's unlikely that you'll meet many other travellers, if any. You have to be willing to meet local people. The women I did meet were lovely, but the overwhelming majority of people I spent time with were men. The overwhelming majority of people on couch-surfing are also men. There were many times where I was the only woman in eyesight, including hours spent in shared taxis with multiple men who did not speak any English. This is a reality and it is something that you have to consider and be comfortable with. Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to plan in advance, but I'm sure it'd be possible to connect with some local women beforehand - or find other ways to meet locals besides couch-surfing.   


I also did not find Kurdish hospitality to be as in-your-face as some people proclaim. I attributed this partly to the shitty weather (less people, including myself, were just leisurely walking around the streets), partly to the language barrier, and partly to being a woman on my own. Locals are much more cautious of randomly approaching a solo female foreigner than a solo male foreigner. Once I started making friends, however, the Kurdish warmth absolutely shone through.   


**Overall Verdict:** A very special trip - definitely worth visiting for those who have personal ties or interest in the region. You are guaranteed to leave with amazing friends, unique memories, and a new understanding of Iraq/Kurdistan.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Important Note:** I really, genuinely loved my experience - it helped shatter so many of my own personal biases. However, I would not recommend Iraqi Kurdistan to anyone new to solo travel or new to more ""challenging"" places.   


Of the three other travellers I met, two of them were full-time vloggers going ""off the beaten path"" as part of their job (nice people - but a very bizarre experience to randomly meet them). I'd hope that someone wouldn't travel to Iraq blindly, but in the age of social media, sometimes these documented highlights can gloss over genuine challenges and safety concerns that the average traveler will face. People can quickly jump to a place because someone on Instagram posted a nice picture of it. Yes, this part of Iraq is filled with beautiful nature, wonderful people, and a surprising sense of stability and safety. I think that reality deserves to be promoted, so that we can fight negative stereotypes and inaccurate Western portrayals (which is partly why I'm writing this). But at the end of the day, Iraqi Kurdistan is still Iraq. Iraq is still Iraq, and while there's an increasing number of people vouching for its tourism potential (myself included), it's important to be realistic about your experience and the context on the ground.   


Have at least a basic understanding of the politics embedded within a new place. Be cautious, alert, and aware that things can change quickly. Have a plan for what will happen if they do. Be mindful of the diversity of local people. Don't expect a backpacking culture. Take the necessary precautions (buy high-risk travel insurance, figure out where the closest embassy is, etc.). Don't be a moron, basically. I know I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but the last thing I'd want is someone reading a trip report, being inspired to go somewhere, and then going.. ""oh fuck, I'm not prepared for this"" AFTER the fact.

TL;DR - first time traveling solo and first time traveling to Japan, did not plan out the trip and need tips. 

After years of wanting to go visit Japan, I was finally able to book my first trip to Japan from June 6-22 and 22-27 in South Korea. This is my first time traveling and first time traveling alone. I always wanted to visit Japan due to my interest in their food, anime, culture, technology,games and scenery. 

I am a 27 year old Asian-American Male, residing in US as a resident. After starting this new job, I have been very flexible with my schedules and was able to book my first trip traveling out of the US. I finally booked the flight because I a saw a cheap ticket and just pulled the trigger on it.

I am a total NEWBIE to traveling, I never travel out of the US ever let alone traveling to Japan myself. I don’t know anything about traveling process and if I need to get a VISA or not, if I have a Chinese passport. You can say I booked this trip with no layout plan. If someone could guide me the right path, that will be great. 

I will be staying in Japan for two weeks, I can’t read, speak, or understand Japanese, only language I know is English but I will try to learn a few phrases before I arrive. 

-What I want to know is the process of traveling solo and what I should expect traveling to Japan and Korea alone. I feel a bit overwhelmed and feel like I should not have booked the ticket, but it’s to late now to cancel. 

I don’t have a layout plans of what I want to do and should do. What I mainly wanted to do is try a lot of food and just get lost to indulge myself in Japan. 

I need some tips from travelers that travel solo before. Such as;
How much money I should bring 
What I need to bring(pack), I want to travel light weight
Where should I stay, hotel or capsule or airbnb, etc
How to stay frugal but can spend more if need to
things I should do or should not do. 
How I should plan out my two week stay 
Places I should go to
Things I should try 
What I should watch out for and avoid 
Best type of events or places during June
Etc.

I am just nervous and kinda scare and not sure how to go about this trip, and not sure how much luggage I should carry. I feel like I shouldn’t have rushed this trip but I been pushing this trip for a few years already. 

I apprentice all the suggestion, tips, roast me, throw them all at me.

Summary: I was travelling solo for the first time to Turkey for dental work and was extremely anxious and scared something bad would happen. 

Well the anxiety went away when I was queuing with everyone for the flight there. Once you're actually there and you're around other excited people who are travelling it definitely puts you at ease I feel. I've learned to accept that bad people can be anywhere and not to live with fear. If anything bad happens, so be it. Got to live your life. 

I was sat next to a lovely old Turkish man on the plane who shook my hand and kept offering me sweets which was so wholesome and calmed me down so much. Once I got to my hotel and looked at the incredible view from my balcony I had a wave of happiness and was so proud of myself. Since then I had a great, relaxing time and everyone, even the dentists which I were terrified of had been nothing but helpful and unbelievably friendly, as had any stranger I've met in the city etc.

Summary: I was travelling solo for the first time to Turkey for dental work and was extremely anxious and scared something bad would happen. 

Well the anxiety went away when I was queuing with everyone for the flight there. Once you're actually there and you're around other excited people who are travelling it definitely puts you at ease I feel. I've learned to accept that bad people can be anywhere and not to live with fear. If anything bad happens, so be it. Got to live your life. 

I was sat next to a lovely old Turkish man on the plane who shook my hand and kept offering me sweets which was so wholesome and calmed me down so much. Once I got to my hotel and looked at the incredible view from my balcony I had a wave of happiness and was so proud of myself. Since then I had a great, relaxing time and everyone, even the dentists which I were terrified of had been nothing but helpful and unbelievably friendly, as had any stranger I've met in the city etc.

TL;DR left my phone in shower at a hostel where a Japanese guy took it, held it for ransom demanding I pay him money for returning it. We took it to the police and they agreed and made me pay the “finder’s fee”


Ok so basically this happened a few nights ago and I’m trying to just move on from it and forgetting the humiliating experience but I’m still feeling a little bitter, so I just want to vent.


I’m a late 20s female who stayed at a lovely and quiet hostel in Osaka. Everything went well until the fourth night there when I left my phone in the shared toilet stall and went to the next stall for a shower. It was gone when I realized I left it behind after I finished. The person took my phone within a ten minute shower and left so fast they didn’t even flush...


I checked Find my iPhone and saw that it was turned off so it was def taken deliberately. My hosts were kind enough to ask around but of course the individual wouldn’t speak up. I was pretty bummed as I wasn’t sure if my phone was automatically updated or not so my Japanese contacts and pics would be lost. But ya know I pulled through and prioritized getting a used phone the next morning so I could at least access google maps and internet. I accepted it was my fault and took the lost.


Next day I’m in Kyoto after having bought a cheap phone when I get an email from the hostel wanting to talk to me about my phone when I get back. So I’m thinking ‘hey they must’ve found it otherwise why would they even email me’. Not gonna lie I went from totally resigned to never seeing it again to cautiously optimistic about it. I came back around 10pm that night and was told in a really indirect and sort of ambiguous way that my phone is with a guest who already checked out. He left his number behind and wanted me to call him. Like, wtf? This confused me so much because why couldn’t he just turn it to the front desk. My second thought was that it was another traveller and that he wanted money from me but my hosts told me definitely not. I had to ask a few specific questions to get a better understanding but it turned out the guy actually told them he had my phone that day and refused to hand it over. He was then subsequently kicked out. The whole situation was bizarre and since hearing he was Japanese I asked my hosts if this is normal which they said no it’s very unusual. 


Anyways so we called him and scheduled to meet at two stations over. My hosts already called the police apparently so I figured why not just meet him like he wants so he can hand me my phone in person. It’s still fucking weird but no harm done right? And I would get it back before I leave Osaka. Well no, we met him and right away he wanted me to sit down for a one on one where the first thing he asked was for my passport. I said absolutely not. He then asked about my phone like how much I bought it for and what condition was it in. At this point I have no idea what he wants but my Host (which I’ll call H) said to play along because he most likely just wants female attention. I told him I got it for $200 used but it was a lie. My BF gave it to me but I didn’t want to mention him in case it set this guy off. After trying to look up my first name online (?) he concluded I would need to pay him $200 or he’d go to the police. At this point I realized this is actually happening to me—that I’m being fucking extorted in japan! I said fine let’s go to the station and H agreed. So us two and this guy who I shall call S for “scumbag” walked to the police station not far from there. 


Right away at the station H and S started talking with passion explaining what happened, even interrupting one another. A lot of the time was spent with H, H’s boss the hostel owner, and S on the phone. I had no what the fuck was happening because no one would tell me shit. But I finally heard from H that what S was saying is true and that I do owe him money. I heard stuff like “Lost and Found” and “Japanese Law” and H reluctantly said that there’s nothing we can do. They must’ve asked me five or six times to pay which I refused. We spent a lot of time arguing what happened to my phone but in the end the cops told me (through H) that I need to prove S stole my phone because it sounds like I lost it. But wth my phone would’ve still been there had he not taken it and turned it off that night. How can it be lost when it was still in the hostel with me there!! 


S btw keeps going over to me saying “I have rights” and “you will be banned from Japan” which infuriated me. He also had the audacity to ask what memory capacity it has to try to milk it for more than 6,000 yen (~$60) they’re making me pay. At that point the senior cop actually took my phone from my hand and looked through it to gauge its value. This was extremely violating for me because I’m very very private. So then they wrote down 5-20% which H explained not great English that that’s what I have to pay. It didn’t make sense though because $60 is 30% of $200 wtf. H explains S also demands I pay H’s boss 10% as I lost my phone on his property. However he told me they’ll be refunded as he was extremely sorry for my being put in this position. I even suggested that S can have the damn phone because I’d rather give it away than pay him but they said it didn’t matter. 


 It’s now close to 1am and seeing how tired H is and being threatened with being prevented from flying home, I agree to pay. To reiterate how ridiculous this law is, they actually made me hand over cash to S. We went to the combini for the cash and H told me to wait then he returned with the cash from the register and told me to take it and hand it to S. I started crying because I felt violated and humiliated but took it and got it over with. I’m handed back my phone without a word from the two cops. 


I asked if H will be reimbursed for the money like the taxi ride and he said no which made me feel so fucking bad. Luckily he wasn’t working the day I checked out so I was able to hand over money in an envelope for him at the desk. 


Sigh, I feel like I’m the only person who was actually extorted for money for losing something in japan. My Japanese friends either have never heard of this law or tells me it’s 5% at most and almost no one would dare ask. So fuck me. I’m glad they decided to go with the $200 instead of the actual resale value because that would’ve been mentally painful to hand $120 or more to this scumbag.

Hey guys, I’m a long time lurker here and I’m excited to head out on my first major trip for \~8 weeks to Europe this summer! I’m 21M and graduating college, and my trip is with a mix of friends, family, and solo.

I would love some help with my itinerary! The first parts are more or less set, but the solo part is completely up in the air. This is my itinerary so far:

Part 1 - Friends

1. Budapest (4 nights)
2. Zagreb (2 nights, train from Budapest)
3. Split (3 nights, bus from Zagreb)
4. Dubrovnik (3 nights, bus from Split)
5. Venice (1 night, flight from Dubrovnik)
6. Florence (4 nights, train from Venice)
7. Munich (3 nights, flight from Florence)
8. Paris (4 nights, flight from Rome)

Part 2 - Family

1. Rome (5 nights, flight from Paris)
2. Sorrento (5 nights, train through Naples)
3. Rome (1 night, on my way back from Sorrento)

Part 3 - Solo

1. Prague (3 nights, flight from Rome)
2. Berlin (4 nights)
3. Copenhagen (3 nights)
4. Amsterdam (5 nights)
5. Brussels (2 nights)
6. Dublin (2 nights)

I’m definitely into nightlife and food, and enjoy most tourist-y activities. As I said, the first two parts are all booked up, so I’d love some help with the solo/third section (after Sorrento/Rome). I have around 2.5 weeks to allocate to solo travel at the end, and the important stops for me are Prague, Berlin, and Amsterdam. Overall I’m a little worried I’m stopping too many times, but I do allocate least 3 nights to almost every place and spend quite a bit of time (4-5 nights) in a lot of places.

I'm a 32 year old woman from England and while this is only my second solo holiday I'm not someone who worries about going somewhere new on my own. I do my research and figure when the choice is go alone or not go I'm only going to regret not going.

Well research doesn't always work. I'm doing an interrail trip to 6 counties and part of my plan was 4 nights in Bratislava, travel in one day, one day in Bratislava, one day in Vienna as its only an hours train away then a free day to do whatever before travel again. I'd picked a cheap hostel with mixed reviews but I only needed somewhere to sleep and change. 

The hostel was nasty and for the first time I didn't feel safe in the area. I'm not going to go into all the details but I knew I couldn't stick to my plan. My next stop was Prague so I booked myself a couple of extra nights there and stayed one more night in that hostel just so I could go to Vienna.

I had mostly been worried about street harassment in Marrakech, since I had heard some horror stories from other travelers. However, I did not experience much at all.  I spent a few days wandering around the old and new part of Marrakech alone, including through the souks. Definitely had some catcalling (and my cab drivers typically hit on me), but nobody ever grabbed me or followed me. I never felt unsafe. I think there were a number of reasons why I had minimal problems with street harassment:

\- I was only alone for a few days and I think my positive experience could in part be attributed to luck

\- I dressed conservatively. Here's an example of an outfit I wore: [https://www.etsy.com/listing/603934895/186-tie-dyed-long-kaftan-simple-dress?ref=pla\_similar\_listing\_top-3&amp;cns=1](https://www.etsy.com/listing/603934895/186-tie-dyed-long-kaftan-simple-dress?ref=pla_similar_listing_top-3&amp;cns=1)

I saw a lot of female tourists wearing short dresses, shorts, shoulders uncovered, tight pants, etc. They seemed to get more negative attention than me. Much of my clothing looked like I was wearing some variation of a blanket/curtain. 

\-I wore sunglasses the entire time (it was sunny, so that wasn't weird). This helped with not making eye contact with strangers. 

\- I tend to walk with purpose - a product of living in a large city. I also ignore strangers (including children..which sounds mean but they can scam you) when they try to talk to me as I'm walking around - I just pretend as if I don't hear them. I don't stare at strangers (sunglasses helps with this). 

\-My first day in Marrakech I booked a walking tour of the old town to help me get comfortable and oriented before exploring on my own. 

\-I did not go out in the city alone after dark. 

I should emphasize that I don't think it's fair that I had to take these precautions, and that I probably was more careful than most tourists, but I wanted to feel as comfortable as possible when exploring the city alone. I will also say that I don't get rattled by catcalling. If a ""hey beautiful"" or some whistling upsets you, then maybe Morocco would be a more difficult experience for you. 

Overall, I had been super nervous to make this trip alone, but I had a wonderful time.

5334,"Hey,

I'm 28 and I've been travelling alone since 2013. I've visited countries including Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, Germany, and Hungary on my own. However, I've been suffering from pretty bad anxiety during that time too.

What concerns me is how many potentially amazing travel experiences I've wasted as a result of said anxiety. My particular forms of anxiety are social anxiety, health anxiety, and panic attacks.

The social anxiety has meant I've never hooked up a lot like most solo travellers. I've made the odd connection here and there with people but a lot of my travel has been done almost totally alone, reading books on the beach or in cafes, going exploring around cities alone, stuff like that.

With the health anxiety and panic attacks, both of them will often flare up during solo trips. I enjoy having beer and when i go to heavy for a couple days in a row, I frequently end up in a poor mental headspace in which I lose a full day of travel due to panic attacks.

Most recently, I was in Saigon for 5 days and I experienced a panic attack after a hard night of drinking. I was so anxious I booked out of my hostel for the night and check3ed into a hotel just so I could be alone. 

I've tried several treatments for anxiety but to be totally honest, I feel it's a very difficult thing to overcome. I will keep working at it, though. 

My main question or advice I'm looking for is whether being an anxious person negates solo travelling, whether the negativity of anxiety negates any positive experiences I've had. 

Using my recent visit to Saigon as an example, I adored the hectic buzz of the city. Catching Grab bikes and visiting amazing attractions like the War Remnants muesum, even though I was totally alone, was very memorable. I loved eating some delicious bahn mi, and I had a gorgeous cup of egg coffee.

But I did have one severe panic attack and because of my shyness or social anxiety I didn't put myself out there much to meet new people. I was content just exploring the place. 

Basically i'd be interested to see if people here think travelling alone as an anxious person is a silly idea.   Any solo travellers here suffer from anxiety?",t5_2rxxm,travel,"Hey,

I was so eager to see the world - I was desperate to be in this place and that place and oh - that place too! I was that person asking for advice on jam packed itineraries on reddit lol. My urge to see everything led me on whirlwind trips to 18 countries throughout the year - the dream right.. 

But I felt so guilty for not enjoying it to the fullest. Sure, I saw so much am extremely grateful for my experiences and they have changed me, but I also spent lots of time stressed / tired / recovering from culture shock. For example, I had my first experience in Egypt then flew to Rio a week later and I had a really hard time adjusting (I know many people won't think these countries invoke culture shock but I was not a very experienced traveller). It wasn't until I actually sat down for 2 weeks in one place that I realised that I was having more intimate, memorable, captivating experiences by just staying enough time in one place. I actually experienced a culture, I had deep and heartfelt conversations with new friends, I learnt the basics of the language: the kind of experiences most people travel for.. the kind of stuff that I wasn't ever going to get out of a whirlwind trip. I started to realise that fast travel and counting countries looked good on my passport but it wasn't the type of travel that allowed me to grow, nor the kind of travel that was bringing me into the present moment or substantially altering my view of the world.

By the end of the year, I was honestly pretty burnt out and ready for a new style of travel. Therefore, I ended up deciding on a 5 month hiatus from everything travel and man I am stoked to get back out there... except this time I only plan to visit one country for 2 months! We'll see where the year takes me but I'm excited to take things slowly and be able to experience the most in one place.

Does anyone have any tips on those destinations? For Almaty, I’m mostly interested in nature (Charyn Canyon, the Kolsai + Kaindy lakes), and for Uzbekistan, mostly the architecture and history. My budget for two weeks is around 1500 usd.

5345,"I was going to write a short version of this as a reply to someone who posted they were going to Japan, but I thought the info might be userful for others so I decided to flesh it out more and post it on its own.

&amp;#x200B;

Japan is one of if not the most solo traveler friendly country in the world in my opinion because it's so easy to eat alone.  Asia in general is pretty solo eater friendly, but Japan kicks it up another notch.  You get way fewer weird looks from other diners and waiters when you eat at a restaurant by yourself and way more restaurants are designed to accomodate solo diners with counters and smaller tables.  Any type of standing restaurant is by default solo friendly!  Plus most of the foods that you want to try(ramen, sushi, yakitori, curry, etc.) are served in single diner portions so you don't have to skip iconic foods that are served in family-style portions you can't eat by yourself.  Solo dining is such a normal thing that there's even a famous Japanese TV show about a salaryman who just goes around eating solo at different restaurants.

&amp;#x200B;

OK, so Japan is a great place to eat solo, but which restaurants should you go to?  That's going to be the big issue if you don't read Japanese because there are SO MANY restaurants in Japan.  In the large cities, there can be dozens on restaurants in a single small block.  You want to find a place with a good selection of food, but with an English menu so you can actually order stuff and at a price you can afford.  That's where these large chain izakaya come in.

&amp;#x200B;

An izakaya is like a Japanese pub, with more emphasis on the food.  They're typically casual places a Japanese person might go with a few buddies after work to grab some drinks and some eats.  The plates are small so you can just order a few snacks to accompany your drinks or order a few more plates and make it a full meal.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is some izakaya have menus that are only written in Japanese hanging on the walls.  And depending on the type of food they're serving, some might be really expensive even though they look like just a hole in the wall.

&amp;#x200B;

That's where chain izakayas come in.  There are many large corporate izakya chains with outlets all over Japan.  Some are more regional and some are totally national.  I know many of us want to patronize local mom and pop places instead of some large soulless corporate chain, but going to these chains means you know what to expect in terms of food and price.  And you know that they will have an English menu so you can actually order those things you had in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

If you just google ""japan izakaya chain"", you'll find lots of lists like this:

[http://trip-n-travel.com/listicle/7011/](http://trip-n-travel.com/listicle/7011/)

&amp;#x200B;

You'll notice that some of the larger chains are so ubiquitous that they show up on most of the lists.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few recommendations I think would be especially good for tourists:

&amp;#x200B;

Kin no Kura (金の蔵) - This chain is everywhere!  You will definitely be walking by branches of this chain on your Japan trip.  Not sure there's anything that stands out in particular about this chain.  Just a solid cheaper izakya with a decent selection of typical Japanese dishes.  And lots of cool interesting drinks that aren't too expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Torikizoku (鳥貴族) - I wouldn't really classify this one as an izakaya because they have a smaller menu that specializes in yakitori, so most of their menu consists of grilled skewered meat.  Everything on the menu is 300 yen(orders of skewers come with 2 skewers for 300 yen).  There's cheaper yakitori if you look for it, but I think Torikizoku has pretty decent quality for the price.  The other big plus is that all the drinks are also 300 yen per order.  So you can try all those flavored Japanese cocktails without breaking the bank.

&amp;#x200B;

Sekai no Yama-chan(世界の山ちゃん) - You'll recognize this by the cartoon birdman on the sign.  It's a Nagoya chain that specializes in Japanese-style wings(tebasaki).  I just think it's a fun place to grab some beer and wings Japanese style.  They have other Nagoya specialties on the menu even if you're not into wings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are many more.  These places don't have the best food you can find in the area, but for first-time visitors who lack the time or experience to hunt down the best whatever restaurants, they're awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

I would recommend going to some of those google links for izakaya chains and learning the names and logos of some of the ones you want to try out.  Then when you're in Japan and walking around trying to find something to eat, you'll recognize some of the signs and not be so intimidated to walk in and check it out.  All of the big chains have English menus and a lot of them have iPad ordering tablets where you can change the language to English and order everything right there without even needing to talk to a waiter.

&amp;#x200B;

I love visiting Japan and even with lots of experience under my belt, knowing that there are a bunch of solid go-to places I can fall back on when I'm there is a huge comfort.  So for anyone going to Japan soon, check some of these places out if you haven't before!

This group of men (not like a drunk stag party group, they just stand at the edge of the road and watch people go by) has been in the same area of Old Town (Melantrichova st) and every night they approach me to find out where I’m staying, if I’m alone, ask me to hang out with them, offer to take me ‘somewhere cooler’ etc. Tonight they really amped it up, one of them followed me for several blocks while I politely asked him to leave me alone. I ended up walking past my hostel bc I didn’t want him knowing where I was staying. After he finally left me alone, I waited awhile before walking back. But, before I made it to my hostel- one of the men that was with him approached me and started doing the same. Then they all started to approach me on every side. I started very loudly asking to be left alone, to which they didn’t care. Luckily, a random man noticed the situation and stepped in to ask if I was okay. The men instantly scrambled. 


It left me uncomfortable and not wanting to stay in this area anymore out of fear of them. Im sure they’re doing this to other solo females as well.

This group of men (not like a drunk stag party group, they just stand at the edge of the road and watch people go by) has been in the same area of Old Town (Melantrichova st) and every night they approach me to find out where I’m staying, if I’m alone, ask me to hang out with them, offer to take me ‘somewhere cooler’ etc. Tonight they really amped it up, one of them followed me for several blocks while I politely asked him to leave me alone. I ended up walking past my hostel bc I didn’t want him knowing where I was staying. After he finally left me alone, I waited awhile before walking back. But, before I made it to my hostel- one of the men that was with him approached me and started doing the same. Then they all started to approach me on every side. I started very loudly asking to be left alone, to which they didn’t care. Luckily, a random man noticed the situation and stepped in to ask if I was okay. The men instantly scrambled. 


It left me uncomfortable and not wanting to stay in this area anymore out of fear of them. Im sure they’re doing this to other solo females as well. Maybe it’s harmless and they just want to “hang out”, idk. They told me they live here in Prague.

5354,"Here are some things I learned during my recent trip in Europe. I think they don't just apply on traveling solo, but on life in general, but the trip made me aware of it:

* Socializing is like a muscle, you need to warm it up every day. Even if you don't feel like it, just make smalltalk to some random person. Afterwards everything is much easier.
* Don't have expectations how your trip will be, because it most likely won't be like that anyways. Just living in the moment and paying attention to the things around you takes a lot of pressure from you.
* It really does not matter what you say to people when introducing yourself. One day I just said ""Hi, I'm X"" and went for a handshake. Afterwards explored the city with these guys for hours and we went for beers in the evening.
* Just showing up is already a big step. Take a book, go to some social place, have a look around once in a while and eventually someone will ask you what you are doing/reading there.
* There are up and downs, and that is fine. Anticipate the downs, take a rest day, but recognize that this is no permanent state. Also try to rationalize why you are feeling down. E.g. for me it was: Bad weather, feeling a bit ill and nobody I could talk to in my hostel.
* Don't let ""failures"" drag you down. One night, I had no plans for the evening and there was nobody in my hostel. I decided to go to an Couchsurfing meetup but it turned out it didn't took place this evening. Later I tried to join a pub crawl in the city but the people there were already pretty drunk and I didn't want to hang out with them. So I decided to go to a bar on my own, but it turned out that they wanted 5€ just for entry. I just went home to the hostel then. I guess such evenings just happen, but I still have experienced more than if I would've stayed at home.

5366,"WARNING: Long story

I'm 19 years old and I'm a guy. 

Two years ago me and 2 friends started making plans for the time after school and before uni. We decided rather quickly on touring through New Zealand. So halfway through the planning my friends decided not to, for whatever reason. 

Last 1,5 year of school pass by and it's June 2018. My friends are going to uni that same year and I'm not because I just went to school for 12 years and want a one year long break before going to uni. I have family in Thailand so I decided to go to Thailand and work with my cousin (I have dual citizenship). Still, one year just working wasn't that appealing so I looked up flights to NZ again and to my surprise they were quite cheap (around 600ish€; tbf I was flying from Thailand). Told my parents and they were like 'yeah sure do whatever you want lol'. So I booked the flight and my parents didn't expect me to do this and instead thought I would chicken out like I always did. And to be honest I was scared as shit. Going all by myself to literally the other side of the world  for 1,5 month was both frightening and exciting because I'm not the most extroverted guy. Since renting a campervan for myself was too expensive I booked a KIWIExperience tour for again another 600ish€ (which I do not regret).

February was just around the corner and I had saved a decent amount of money from working with my cousin (wasn't enough lol). Bought a decent 35l backpack, packed my clothes (enough for a week of each shirts, boxers, socks, and shorts/pants) and off to Auckland I was. First days in NZ felt surreal like really weird. You are all by yourself, no one to talk to. But that changed once I left Auckland behind and started my tour. I sat next to a Brit on the Bus who also happened to travel alone so we awkwardly exchanged formalities and talked a bit. With every hour that passed the more comfortable I got talking to him and other strangers. 

2 weeks passed and not only did I get comfortable talking to complete strangers but I haven't felt alone because I wasn't. I completely forgot that I was supposed to be there with my friends who dumped me and instead the guys and I met became friends even if only temporarily.

I had a lot of first times in NZ:
First time in a hostel 
First time in an Irish pub
First time surfing
First  2am ocean swim
First time tea with milk
First time crawling in complete darkness through a cave 
First 3am walk to a mountain top to catch the amazing sunrise
First time running out of money lol (absolutely worth it)
And of course the first time experiencing the obligatory guy with a guitar in a hostel and on the beach.

I am so grateful for my friends opting to go to uni and that I made the riskiest choice in my still young life because if not than I would have missed out on a lot of stuff. 
I can't wait for my next solo adventure (which is just 1,5 months away) and I can only recommend going solo.

I really wonder why people feel this is something that you ought to be doing when you are younger. Is it just another part of our cultural tendency to designate everything fun and worthwhile to people in their teens and 20s?

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and I also don't understand people who say that the hostel dorm thing is for younger kids and that if you're 30 you should get your own room. Uhhhh no, I definitely prefer to be in a hostel dorm where I can hang out with other travelers. Young people who find it weird to be rooming with a 30 year old are stupid and we should stop encouraging their stupidity.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like society with its norms and expectations always manages to take the fun out of everything. ",30 is old to be backpacking? Really?,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/b4ge8q/30_is_old_to_be_backpacking_really/

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 41 years old. I've been married for 15 years and have 4 kids age 2-11. I love travel and have loved it my whole life. My father is a retired airline pilot (United) and for the first 6 months this year, we have his standby passes that allow my wife and I to travel as much as we like until July anywhere United flies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have a full time job that I can't up and walk away from and combined with my kids at home and other responsibilities, my wife and I can't really travel together. We have decided to just take long weekend solo trips while the other spouse stays home with the kids. I generally leave on thursday morning and come home sunday night (I have some PTO and I work my schedule that I can get most of my work done MTW). Same schedule for my wife. 

It has been a blast despite the quick trips. Here is a quick rundown of what we have done so far:

&amp;#x200B;

January: I traveled to Amsterdam/Bruges. One full day in Amsterdam and one full day in Bruges. Both are fantastic cities to wander and people watch. Bruges was my favorite. Such a fantastic little medieval city and the waffles and fries can't be beat

&amp;#x200B;

February: Mexico City. CDMX has never been on my radar for whatever reason, but man am I glad I went! 3 days of cheap tacos, awesome museums, luche libre wrestling and wandering. Such a great city!

&amp;#x200B;

March: my wife and I were actually able to go to Italy for 4 days together, so yeah, not solo travel, but I thought I'd throw it in there. Rome, Florence and Pisa. Loved it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife has done California, Maui and she is currently in Edinburgh Scotland as I type this. 

Next week, I am most likely going to Buenos Aires or Tel Aviv/Jerusalem for my solo travel. Future destinations before July include: Athens, Stockholm and Osaka. May be able to get another trip in there as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have used lots of hotel points, so these trips (including basically free airfare... do have to pay taxes, usually between 20-80 bucks) have been very budget friendly.

As a solo female traveler safety is always on my mind. I just got to an Air bnb in Australia and the owner kind of caught me off guard. She is out of town Sunday-Wednesday and she rented out her other room to a man and she won’t have time to meet him. That means I’m going to be alone in her home with a guy I don’t know for 2 nights. There’s no locks on the doors (bedrooms or bathrooms) so I’m wondering what I can do to feel safe.
I have a chair in the room but it’s super short and made of wicker so I can’t wedge it under the door knob. I’m planning to go to a hardware store today to see if they have the portable locks online. I don’t think there would be time to have a lock shipped online so I’m trying to think of a store or DIY trick (I saw one with a fork where you saw it up, but I don’t think this lady had any tools). 
I feel paranoid and afraid people are going to judge me, but I just don’t think I’m going to sleep well without having a game plan.

5374,"Hey all, 

So I recently got back from my first solo trip to Japan. While this isnt the first time I have been to Japan (actually my 6th), this is the first time I have really traveled by myself, and with no real itinerary (been super busy at work and home.) I booked hotels in Tokyo and Kyoto, and ordered the rail pass, but had no real plans. So for my entire stay, I decided what city I wanted to see the day before (that was reasonably close by train), and traveled to it on a whim. From there, I would pick a few things on the map, and just walk the entire city; discovering places, food, and people as I go. It was an amazing experience. 

My trip was only about 9 days, but I kinda crammed them. I visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Hiroshima, Miyajima, Kamakura, and Enoshima; with the exception of Tokyo and Kyoto, walking most of them (over 175 miles walked or hiked total.)  

Some of the highlights: 

* Celebrating a shared birthday with a bunch of Japanese salarymen (Golden Gai.) This was actually pretty funny as the guy whose birthday I shared keep switching between being low and high energy, while his co-workers worked to keep him leveled. They were all pretty cool and funny though. 
* Hopped into a random bar (Golden Gai), and shared some conversation with these random dudes traveling from Hiroshima. We ended up talking for a few hours and before leaving, they came over and thanked me for talking to them and told me how I had made their evening. It was really touching. 
* Hopped into a bar (Golden Gai), where the bartender had to remove one of the overly drunk guys. In the US, this typically means physically throwing someone out, but it seemed like they both were trying to remain polite to each other (and the other bar patrons) while almost wrestling with one another (you could see the physical exertions on their faces.) This actually became my go-to spot to drink while waiting for the train to open up at 430AM. One evening, I ended up sticking around, and getting invited to karaoke with them after the bar closed til 10am. 
* Hopped into a random jazz bar (Golden Gai.) One of the bar's patrons came over and asked me about what kind of music I was into and then we proceeded to share music back and forth for hours. I was really surprised by the stuff she was into. 
* Hopped into a bar (Golden Gai) with an older guy, a transgendered woman, and a young couple on their first date. We had the craziest conversations about life, relationships, love, and American slang for hours. They were all so nice. 
* Drunkenly dropping my glasses into a bowl of ramen at 5AM. I still need to get them professionally cleaned. 
* Chatting with the owner of a jazz bar in Kyoto who introduced me to Crazy Ken Band and some other Japanese jazz and soul bands. 
* All the random conversations with random strangers in random bars. 

It was such an amazing trip, and despite all of the cities and sites I visited, I miss all the conversations with complete strangers the most. It really allowed me to get into my own headspace, and really force myself to step out of my normal bounds (I'm kinda an introvert.) In the beginning of the trip, I felt kind of lonely, but by the end I could understand the meaning of one finding solace in solitude. It was an amazing experience. Leaving really felt bittersweet.

yes it was scary. scary until i landed! once i was there all of those nerves seemed to vanish, because i was in the now- i was present instead of thinking of all of the what if’s and worst case scenarios.

I did three nights in Alicante, Spain, primarily because it is cheap and easy to get to from where I live. In hindsight, Alicante is a great place for a first-time solo traveller.

For me it was perfect because tourism is well established here, everyone speaks at least a little English and I felt completely comfortable as a solo tourist.

- I miss talking. I've barely spoken in three days and I notice it. I've messaged my husband more often than I would have liked, just because I've been thinking of things I wanted to tell him.

- Eating alone isn't the easiest. I felt like a burden in a couple of restaurants, I've not been able to enjoy sharing foods such as paella, but largely I've been treated very well.

- The freedom is wonderful. I like to march round the cities I visit, sometimes covering 15+ miles a day. This is normally accompanied by my husband moaning at the amount of walking. I've loved the freedom to do my own thing this weekend. And boy did I put in the miles!

- Walking tours are great. I've done two this weekend - a free walking tour, and a gastronomic one. Both were great. The free walking tour had a number of other solo travellers on it who I chatted to and who made me feel less alone.

5387,"Hey guys,

Massive post from a first-time solo traveller. I'm planning a trip to Japan in late March or April for 2-3 weeks since it'll be cherry blossom season soon. I've thrown together a list of places I'd be interested in checking out, please comment on anything I'm missing on the list or if something's not worth the trouble. I can explain the reasons I've picked out specific places. I'm looking for activities rather than just seeing things so I'd love suggestions for stuff like rock climbing, bicycling, etc. except water sports. 

**Language**

I don't speak Japanese, what common words and phrases should I be familiar with? Any apps other than Google Translate and Lens that are useful? I'm thinking at least hello, excuse me, sorry my Japanese isn't good, what can I get without meat and where is the bathroom. Would you recommend a quick Duolingo or Rosetta Stone course? In my experience I learn languages much better in a classroom environment


**Food**

I'm a vegetarian and I'm aware that this likely complicates life for me in Japan but I'd appreciate any directions from vegetarians who have travelled in Japan on finding stuff to eat or carry. I like cooking so I might be able to handle making simple meals if I have a kitchen. I'd be interested in short cooking lessons in Japanese cuisine but I can't think of anything not involving meat except tea. I've read about vending machines for the craziest variety of food or drinks, do these accept payment other than cash?


**Accomodation**

I'd like to try a ryokan once but otherwise I'm probably going for stuff like hostels or business hotel rooms. Any specific ryokan that I should visit? Is couchsurfing.com or Airbnb a good bet for finding a place as well?


**Phone**

Lasts 1.5 days with my low-ish usage and I'm packing a 10000mAh powerbank in case it gets low. Any phone carriers you'd recommend for the trip?

**Money**

I should have a credit card with me and some cash. Are there any widely accepted preloaded cards I can use instead of the ATMs and my card instead if it saves on transaction charges? How much cash should I carry on me in cities and in more remote locations?


**Getting around**

I plan on getting a rail pass. What are some ways of getting around in the cities? Is the rail system good enough for intra-city travel that I needn't look for options? Is there something like a bike share or rent program I might be able to find for smaller distances? Are Ubers easy to find and are they cheaper than taxis?


**Luggage**

I am normally a heavy packer because I pack multiple outfits and especially shoes to match. It seems that packing light is recommended for travelling in trains especially as they might not have the room to stow a larger suitcase. Should I go for a rucksack or a medium-sized roller suitcase? I'd like enough room for around 10 shirts/T-shirts, 3 pairs of shorts, a pair of jeans, 2 pairs of shoes + boots, a jacket, and socks + underwear for the entire trip. I don't plan on buying a lot of stuff while I'm there but I'd like to leave room for Japanese Kit-Kats or art pieces.


**Laundry**

Are laundromats easily accessible in larger cities for washing and drying? This would help reduce the number of clothes I'm carrying on me especially in a rucksack.

**Tokyo**

* Shibuya Crossing

It isn't in any particular order yet. I'd like recommendations on places to visit that I missed or something that can be skipped and create a schedule based on that/
___

*Some other stuff I'm interested in:*

**Cherry Blossoms**

This is a big reason for me planning this trip now so I'd like to get the most I can out of it. [This link](https://www.japan-guide.com/sakura/) shows that my travel dates would line up better for the northern regions. Any recommendations on places that fit my schedule for the best views?


**Music**

I love music and bandsintown doesn't really show anything I'd like for my dates but suggestions for any popular music locations or events I should look into are welcome

**Cat/Dog cafe**

I'm a dog person through and through but I've never really heard of dog cafes so I'd like to check out cat cafes instead. Any particular ones I can go to around the places I've mentioned?

**Pottery**

Someplace I can see demonstrations and maybe pick up some souvenirs


**Golden Week**

This seems like an interesting event to watch but it's also a very busy tourist season. Is this worth planning to stay in Tokyo for (or any other city)? 


**Shopping districts/centers**

Something unique that would be fun to just walk through

- I like walking around the city when possible to get a feel of how it is outside of tourist areas
- I try to be adventurous with food (in term of what I order, not about if it looks sanitary... I learned my lesson many years ago haha)

Fast forward to this year... I randomly decided I wanted to spend a weekend in Vancouver, Canada. What did I do? Booked a solo trip. 

My favorite TV show (Crazy Ex Girlfriend) is doing a live show in New York City. None of my friends are fans of the show. What did I do? Got myself a ticket to the show and booked a solo trip to NYC. Hell, I might go watch a broadway play. Would my friends want to do that? No way.

Fast forward to this year... I randomly decided I wanted to spend a weekend in Vancouver, Canada. What did I do? Booked a solo trip. 

My favorite TV show (Crazy Ex Girlfriend) is doing a live show in New York City. None of my friends are fans of the show. What did I do? Got myself a ticket to the show and booked a solo trip to NYC. Hell, I might go watch a broadway play. Would my friends want to do that? No way.

5401,"I love travelling. But I find that a lot of people around me do not. Being a solo traveller, this makes things even worse, because concerns about safety and what not are brought up.

Some context:

I am Dutch, but my parents are immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. We didn't travel much during my childhood, unless it was to visit relatives abroad. As an adult I've expressed my frustration to my mom and sister about the lack of travelling. I'm 26 now, but I feel like I've missed out on so much. Even art galleries and places to see in my own city of Amsterdam were left unexplored.

The general response however, is that all this stuff about seeing places is unnecessary. My mom and sister are content living in the same place forever. They are also not interested in eating 'exotic' foods and when I grew up we never ate anything besides the 10-15 dishes that my mom has always made, neither did we go out to eat. My sister has grown up to be the same type of person as our mom.

My dad however is very supportive and he also encourages me to see new things and places. The only thing is that he is getting old and cannot do the same things I can or want to do (such as hiking).

I've visited these markets for years across SE Asia, Japan, and Hong Kong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Love them or hate them, these markets tend to be significant attractions across SE Asia.  I find them interesting, as contrary to common traveler belief, there are unique items to be found in them amongst the generic Chinese or Thai manufactures.  

&amp;#x200B;

The most interesting find for me, bar none, was the matte-finish cutlery  fashioned from recycled Vietnam War bombs/ordinance, available in Laos. If I owned a cafe, I'd probably buy out the lady's tent.  

&amp;#x200B;

A relatively new arrival spotted in HK but also found in SE Asia are elaborate ""pop-up"" greeting cards with all sorts of designs - ships-of-the-line, sailing junks, rickshaws, dragons, the Eiffel tower, etc etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Selective textile pieces can be interesting as well - sarongs in Bali/Yangon, certain blouses/shirts in Chiang Mai (northern Thai style, very distinct from the usual t-shirts and elephant apparel).  

&amp;#x200B;

Jewelry is a tough one - I'd never buy gold off the street (Chinatown, Bangkok is pretty awesome for that if you have the cash).  Silver and gemstones though...trained buyers of the latter will visit the markets of Burma and Cambodia with briefcases of money behind them.  I do buy a silver\* item here and there if I get a decent price (spot .999 silver is only 50 US cents per gram, so few pieces will have more than a *theoretical*\* US$15-18 of metal content - a ring might be $1). I typically try and pay $1 per gram weight, and many sellers have a gram scale. I carry a magnet to check for iron/steel (although it doesn't work for silver-plated copper or cupro-nickel items).  \*Silver/\*theoretical - the odds of fraudulently marked sterling/925 silver are high. Thus, I don't buy unless it fits my number one rule for general market buying - **Am I happy with the item itself at the price paid?**  This means....would you like this item even if the ""locally made"" shirt were trucked from China? If the silver were pot metal, etc etc?  

&amp;#x200B;

I find the surveying and haggling process fun, even if I don't buy anything.  Any particular favorite markets?   Sunday in Chiang Mai was a favorite. Downtown Yangon and Siem Reap aren't bad.  I wasn't a a huge fan of the markets in Ubud.  Bangkok has so much it's overwhelming. 

     Street/night markets in Asia",t5_2rxxm,travel,"""Handsome man, I give you good price!""

An exchange of numbers on a calculator...

Local beer tank tops &amp; t-shirts

Elephant pants

$8 ""Nike"" sneakers

Fruit-shaped carved soap

Skewered scorpions for your delectation...

&amp;#x200B;

I've visited these markets for years across SE Asia, Japan, and Hong Kong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Love them or hate them, these markets tend to be significant attractions across SE Asia.  I find them interesting, as contrary to common traveler belief, there are unique items to be found in them amongst the generic Chinese or Thai manufactures.  

&amp;#x200B;

The most interesting find for me, bar none, was the matte-finish cutlery  fashioned from recycled Vietnam War bombs/ordinance, available in Laos. If I owned a cafe, I'd probably buy out the lady's tent.  

&amp;#x200B;

A relatively new arrival spotted in HK but also found in SE Asia are elaborate ""pop-up"" greeting cards with all sorts of designs - ships-of-the-line, sailing junks, rickshaws, dragons, the Eiffel tower, etc etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Selective textile pieces can be interesting as well - sarongs in Bali/Yangon, certain blouses/shirts in Chiang Mai (northern Thai style, very distinct from the usual t-shirts and elephant apparel).  

&amp;#x200B;

Jewelry is a tough one - I'd never buy gold off the street (Chinatown, Bangkok is pretty awesome for that if you have the cash).  Silver and gemstones though...trained buyers of the latter will visit the markets of Burma and Cambodia with briefcases of money behind them.  I do buy a silver\* item here and there if I get a decent price (spot .999 silver is only 50 US cents per gram, so few pieces will have more than a *theoretical*\* US$15-18 of metal content - a ring might be $1). I typically try and pay $1 per gram weight, and many sellers have a gram scale. I carry a magnet to check for iron/steel (although it doesn't work for silver-plated copper or cupro-nickel items).  \*Silver/\*theoretical - the odds of fraudulently marked sterling/925 silver are high. Thus, I don't buy unless it fits my number one rule for general market buying - **Am I happy with the item itself at the price paid?**  This means....would you like this item even if the ""locally made"" shirt were trucked from China? If the silver were pot metal, etc etc?

3 years back I was wanting to go on a vacation. None of my friends, family or colleagues wanted to go. So I gave up the plans. 

Until it hit me: you can solo travel! As an introvert! 

I set off on a week trip by myself. It was scary and lonely. I stayed in my hostel room and finally decided to venture out one day. It was awesome! I ended up meeting pretty cool people from across the globe and heard all their stories. 

It dawned on me that these people were in the exact boat as I was. Only my introverted personality made me feel like I was alone...in reality I was alone because I chose to keep myself like that. 

Fast forward and 5 more solo trips later, I realized solo travelling is what you make of it. You can either stay inside(which is fine) or go out there and meet new people. 

My introversion was the only thing holding me back from having fun. And sometimes I realize that is ok to stay in once in a while because being solo, there’s that freedom. 

But to all the introverted solo travellers out there, make the most of your trip. You can stay home and wallow, being on a trip is not the time. 

On another note, I never do things I don’t want to do or push myself to have a great time when I know I won’t. 

Has travelling solo made me an extrovert? Hell no. I’m still 90% introverted. 

But it’s given me the confidence and helped me relax when meeting new people. I’ve shared experiences with people I probably will never see again which in a way is delightful.

There were a lot of highs and lows, from falling in love, meeting many amazing people, seeing some of the coolest things on this planet to crippling loneliness, exhaustion and terrible sickness.

I started by surfing for a week in Portugal then headed to Ibiza to party for a week. I then got lost on the Greek islands, headed to India to eat some of the best food I've ever had, did some intense hiking in Nepal then flew to Japan. After Japan I started my SEA route: Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore. 
After Singapore, I headed home (UK) for a week and then flew to Argentina. I went down to Patagonia, zigzagging between Chile and Argentina as I worked my way North. After spending a few months in Chile and Easter Island, I headed over to Bolivia for a month and then on to Peru. I looped back round to briefly see Brazil and then hopped on a flight to South Africa where I spent my last 2 months.

I think I spent approx. $23,000 USD with flights, insurance etc - I wasn't particularly frugal about activities or tours (scuba diving qualifications, bungee jumping, trekking in Patagonia etc) but I stayed in hostel dorms (sometimes Airbnbs) and cooked for myself if it was an expensive country. 

Anyone thinking of taking a similar trip:

1. If you're heading to South/Central America, learn some Spanish before you go. Even learning the basics will help massively.

2. Write a journal. I took many, many photos but didn't write anything. It's so easy to forget who you meet and how you felt day to day. It only takes 10 minutes a day and it's something you can read 30 years from now.

3. Pack light. I took a 40L hand luggage bag and wished it was lighter!

4. And most importantly, the biggest thing I enjoyed about this trip was the people I met. The people I met changed my life, my perspective on things, and opened my eyes. Take every chance you can to talk to new people.

5434,"Hi all, 28/m/american here just thought I'd share notes from my solo experience in Italy since I used this subreddit a lot for advice and maybe it would help someone else doing a search and trying to plan.

**Rome**

Hostel: I stayed at The Yellow which seems to be the most popular hostel there. It's quite close to the central Termini station so it's real slick for getting to the airport. It's in the other direction from the usual sights you'd want to see, so there is a bit of walking, but I enjoyed that it's near restaurants that are less touristy and more affordable. Clean air conditioned rooms with a bathroom and shower. I mostly want to emphasize that if you're staying at this hostel you should intend to visit the bar. There's 20% off drinks via a yellow wristband if you booked thru their website, and you also get to skip the line on a popular nights when people are queued outside. It can get very packed in there and at midnight they open up the basement to DJing and dancing. If you're not into the party you might consider staying elsewhere as the noise from the street might keep you up at night.

I did the Vatican tour twice, both were night openings which are only on Friday. Even despite having read that the night openings have fewer people, it still got quite crowded. Arrive 20-30 minutes before your scheduled time. There will be a line that looks long but it moves fast. The Pinacoteca did not seem to be open during the night tour, which has Leonardo's St. Jerome in the Wilderness. From the entrance, signs will guide you through a winding series of buildings containing a multitude of artifacts, before ending at the Sistine Chapel. Once you leave a room you can't go back in it and guards will enforce this. I was primarily there to see the chapel, and when I entered it there was perhaps only a dozen other people in there which was incredible and serene. Once the tours start to end there it gets quite full and every couple minutes one of the security guards will speak into a microphone broadcast over speakers to remind people to be silent and not take photos. All the hushed chatter and crowds in there kind of breaks the serenity which is a shame so I found it much more fulfilling to drown it all out with a recording of Allegri's Sistine Codex of 1661 composition as performed by the Sistine Chapel Choir and recorded in there - [Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/track/0OT5WJya3evB1ghK4anB3R?si=Wp8H20hcQjizwRZmwH8seQ) \- that really made the experience complete and was a highlight of the trip.

St. Peter's Basilica is free but there can be a very lengthy line, I visited twice and found it better to go very early or towards the end of the day. Even considering the line, it's worth it and is unbelievable. It's the largest church in the world. Spend some serious time in there taking it all in.

Buy Colosseum tickets at the Forum box office. Don't fall for any unofficial ""skip the line"" vendors. I paid 12euro for a ticket valid for 48 hours that includes one visit to the Colosseum and Forum, as well as some other museums. I showed up to the Colosseum at probably 10:30am on a Saturday and went right past the long line of people waiting to buy a ticket and was in within a few minutes.

The Trevi Fountain is selfie stick central. Even at 11pm it was still mobbed, but I saw a wedding proposal!

If you're into art, the various churches around town are super cool. Santa Maria della Vittoria was near the Yellow hostel and has Bernini's Ecstasy of Saint Teresa. To see an incredible sculpture like that in the space it was designed for that it's been in since it was made was really special. And it's free and there were like 10 people in there. That's the real experience. San Luigi dei Francesi is another great one and has several Caravaggios. It's not a church, but the Galleria Doria Pamphilj has Velazquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X which many consider to be the finest portrait ever created. San Pietro in Vincoli is perhaps the coolest, housing Michelangelo's Moses sculpture that Freud analyzed at length. It's crazy to just walk into a church for free and see one of his most regarded statues, meanwhile people line up for hours to pay to see the David.

**Naples**

Hostel: I stayed at Hostel of the Sun which was funky and very charming with friendly staff. It is located on the 7th floor of a building with other tenants, and the elevator occasionally requires 10c to operate. Do the Capri tour if you can, it was maybe the highlight of my whole trip. Boat tour driven by this guy named Mister Luigi who sang opera as we cruised past the blue grotto, incredible.

Via Tribunale is the street to go down for pizza, it's pretty much a narrow alleyway with pizzerias every few steps and they're all great and affordable. Get the fried pizza, it's the original calzone and was invented in Naples. Sorbillo Esterina is the spot that's been doing it since the 30s and it was incredible and only like 3.50euro.

I had read that Naples was dirty with bad crime and had nothing to see other than getting away from it to tour Pompeii and didn't really agree with that. It was the least touristy place I visited and felt the most authentically Italian. I walked the alleyways alone at night and certainly felt safer than I do walking around certain parts of Chicago or New York at night. I found a couple lively public squares near Via Tribunale that got full of life at night with people just getting beers from the corner market and hanging out near some big old statue.

**Venice**

Hostel: L'Imbarcadero - small and cozy hostel, highly recommended for the great location, friendly staff and especially the proximity to the train station. It's situated right on the grand canal.

I want to emphasize that I'd read so much about Venice being underwhelming, ""you can see it in a day"" etc and as soon as I got there I fell in love with it and realized how misguided that criticism is. That's a comment from people who travel to cross boxes off a checklist. It was my favorite place on the whole trip, even including Cinque Terre. There's not a car to be found and you lose track of time, and lose yourself in the maze of it all, that's the wonder of it. The thing you do is just get lost and find a new favorite cafe or spot to relax every day. I could have stayed for a week. It's touristy in the sense that tourists go there, but it's not like there's any fast food or even hardly any spot that's totally mobbed with people taking selfies besides the main bridge or something. I found it to be extremely charming and quiet and the stars come out at night. I'd find a nice canal to sit by with wine and my jazz softly playing as gondolas float by under starlight. That is called truly being on vacation.

Bacareto Da Lele was maybe my favorite spot I found - tiny corner cafe the size of a bathroom with no seating, you get a little sandwich and wine and eat it by the canal outside. It's an extremely affordable and seemingly popular neighborhood spot, I mean a glass of wine was seriously 60 or 80 cents and a sandwich only a couple euro, it was incredible. And I found it just from wandering!

**Florence**

Hostel: PLUS Florence - good but wasn't in love with it. Neighborhood isn't great, the pool courtyard area was alright besides the music being way too loud, I dunno, it was mostly college kids sitting in their own cliques.

As soon as I got to Florence and wandered around for a bit I knew I was a bit optimistic in booking 5 nights there. It's perfectly fine but like Rome and Naples, it can be a pretty dang loud crowded place and sometimes you need space to breathe. I booked 3 extra nights in Cinque Terre on the spot and told the hostel employees I'd be leaving 3 days early and they said they couldn't refund me for the canceled nights, which was surprising since I'd done this in other countries before.

Art museums: The Accademia is basically a small L-shaped museum with a dome specifically built to house the David and not much else. I got there before opening one morning and there was already a line, but it was cool to be in there briefly before the crowds hit. Buy a ticket in advance, but don't believe the ""skip the line"" tagline, as with many offers advertising with this phrase, you'll still be in a line... just a shorter one. Same for the Uffizi, the line I waited in for people with reservations appeared to be about as long as the line for people buying tickets. If you're an art nerd you should dedicate a whole day to the Uffizi as the collection is pretty amazing, not overwhelmingly huge and has nothing worth skipping.

If you're not an art buff and don't feel like waiting, go to the Palazzo Vecchio / Piazza della Signoria to see an exact replica of the David in its original location. Anyone visiting Florence will likely go through this plaza anyway as it's centrally located. I found it almost more powerful to see the David where it was intended to be, in relation to the other statues there, and without being swarmed by a mob of people taking selfies.

**Cinque Terre**

Hostel: First I stayed at Affittacamere Patrizia, then at Mar-Mar, both in Riomaggiore. They were just a few steps from each other, right by the sea port. Mar Mar had a balcony with a view of the colored houses of Riomaggiore that was just stunning. On my final day I just stayed up there and drank wine and hung out with other guests, no need to even leave.

A lot of hostels advertised as being in Cinque Terre are actually in La Spezia or are far up the hill from the town and require a bus or something - I would highly recommend staying in one of the towns proper and not staying anywhere that requires a bus or even a bit of a hike to get into town. In the morning and late at night when the tour groups are gone are when it really feels like itself. Go down on the rocks to watch the sunset. Find a dark spot to watch the stars at night, I have almost never seen so many. That's where the magic is.

I was expecting a quiet remote little coastal town that moves slowly... apparently many people did! It can get quite full during the day because of tour groups taking day trips. I mean like the train between towns at 4pm on a regular Tuesday was entirely packed body to body without even room for one more person on there so people almost fall over when it comes to a stop. That's like London during rush hour, this was the last place on earth I expected to see crowds like that.

Monterosso has the most stylish beach and boardwalk but I believe you have to pay to even be on the beach in most parts. Vernazza has a bunch of cool little shops and cafes lining narrow alleyways to explore. Corniglia was only accessible via some lengthy winding stairs, avoid if you don't feel like doing all the steps up to it. Riomaggiore was my favorite and pretty much had it all, places to eat, the iconic colorful houses, and a rocky beach with perfectly clear water. Manarola was similar to Riomaggiore with a just-right balance of dining and scenery.

**General notes**

This is what has come up most frequently when my friends ask about the trip - I couldn't find any serious nightlife! I went out every night but only ever found three spots that were lively and packed, and realized each time that almost all of the patrons were tourists or exchange students, mostly college-aged, which I guess was fine to me to party with other native english speakers, but I did not once see a lively bar full of Italians and I certainly tried to find it. The Yellow bar in Rome is very clearly the only spot with any activity at all for many blocks around it at midnight on a Friday, and that's all tourists. It was the same in Florence at this spot called The Lion's Fountain. The Trastevere neighborhood in Rome has several lively bars but again, it was clearly mostly college kids and I felt a little awkward. There were plenty of people my age drinking with friends in the public square though, so maybe that's where it's at? I travel semi-often and have never been anywhere where I couldn't find a place with many locals drinking, it was the weirdest thing. I'm going to assume I never found the right neighborhoods, but even then, if you're in most huge cities, it ain't that hard to find a bar with people at it. So I quickly changed my hopes from finding bars and meeting people, to getting a nice bottle of wine and finding a place to relax with my music.

The degree to which Italians speak English was perhaps overstated. I had no problems ordering at restaurants but trying to have a conversation beyond that was generally not going to go far. Service was perfectly fine and I never had an interaction with an Italian that wasn't courteous.

If you ask for a coffee, what you will get is an espresso shot, so get a cappuccino.

Food was surprisingly affordable. Restaurants generally either offer first and second course (pasta then meat), and pizza. In Rome I could get a two course meal with two glasses of wine for under 20 euro, and the food was never not amazing. A real Napoli pizza is like 6 euro. It generally seemed like you don't pick a specific restaurant you want to eat at, you just see what looks authentic and has seating, they'll all be good. I never ate a meal indoors either. Cafe seating is the way when it's nice out.

It's true that many places do shut down for the afternoon, so plan accordingly. If it's open at 4pm it's probably a tourist spot.

The drivers are crazy so be careful when crossing intersections. I took a cab once and the guy was just reckless but seemed perfectly calm. Cars may come alarmingly close to you, I got gently hit from behind by a cab once but that's what happens when the streets are so old and narrow and have a bunch of people on them.

Jeez I wrote a lot. I had a wonderful time and as with any place, it was different than I expected, which is the fun of traveling, so I hope this helps even one person. I went in late August - early September and still caught the tail end of the tourist season as well as the heat, so perhaps traveling more towards the spring or fall would be most ideal. Overall, I highly recommend almost everywhere I stayed and visited, and especially if you're an art buff or a foodie you will be in heaven!

The drivers are crazy so be careful when crossing intersections. I took a cab once and the guy was just reckless but seemed perfectly calm. Cars may come alarmingly close to you, I got gently hit from behind by a cab once but that's what happens when the streets are so old and narrow and have a bunch of people on them.

Jeez I wrote a lot. I had a wonderful time and as with any place, it was different than I expected, which is the fun of traveling, so I hope this helps even one person. I went in late August - early September and still caught the tail end of the tourist season as well as the heat, so perhaps traveling more towards the spring or fall would be most ideal. Overall, I highly recommend almost everywhere I stayed and visited, and especially if you're an art buff or a foodie you will be in heaven!","Just returned from 2 1/2 weeks in Italy - tips and advice for Rome, Naples, Venice, Florence, Cinque Terre",https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/9hsuw7/just_returned_from_2_12_weeks_in_italy_tips_and/

5436,"Hello all!

I'm very proud (and nervous af) to say that I will soon be setting off on my first ever solo trip.

I'm 22F from London UK, and on October 2nd I'll be flying to Perth AU to start a 12-14 month journey:

* Australia (6-7 months)
* New Zealand (3-4 months)
* Fiji (around 1 month)
* Tonga (around 1 month)
* Possibly other destinations in the South Pacific (Samoa? Vanuatu?) IF I have enough time/money, AND if I can find suitable flights.
* If I have any time/money left AT ALL after all that, I'll head up into South East Asia. 

The only flight I have booked is my initial one. I have a week in a Perth hostel, and tentative plans to pick up a car so I can drive up the coast for a few weeks. But beyond that, I'm totally free.

But the reason I wanted to post is less about where I'm going, and more about solo travel in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I intend to take the ""plan as I go"" approach for my whole trip. It's worked for me before when travelling with other people, and I prefer to be flexible and take opportunities as they arise. I'll definitely be doing the more 'social' brand of solo travel. I love the atmosphere of hostels (yes, even the louder and dirtier ones), and meeting new people from the local area, as well as from around the world. I'm also down for linking up with other travellers for periods of time, as long as the overall arc of my trip remains my own.

That being said... *It's really difficult to leave home for so long, alone.*

And I don't mean emotionally, as much as that it's hard fucking work. All my romantic notions of jumping on a plane and travelling the world for a year have been dashed by the realisation being so spontaneous takes a lot of preparation. Especially going solo. I can't expect to just be 'along for the ride' at any point.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So...

I've quit my job and sub-let my flat; while clearing it out I discovered piles of stuff I don't use anymore and gave it to charity.

I've tried to spend time with all my friends individually, and to go to all my favourite places in London. I even went to places in London I've never been to before, in a sort of weird low-key panic that they might be gone by the time I return?

I've wrapped and hidden Christmas and Birthday presents around my family's house.

I've overcome my lifelong aversion to social media, after it was pointed out that it was my only real hope of keeping in touch with everyone back home. I am now the proud owner of a shiny new Instagram account. I'll learn to use it as I go.

I've realised how many subscriptions I pay for that I simply won't need while I'm on the other side of the world. Spotify, Audible and Netflix I'm keeping. Everything else can go.

I've made an ungodly amount of lists. Packing lists. To do lists. Bucket lists. Lists of third cousins I've never spoken to, friends of friends of friends, and even the odd Internet Stranger, who could *potentially* be an emergency contact if I find myself stuck in x-town, or in fear for my life in y-city.

I've done countless hours of research about the less glamorous side of travelling long term. I need to be able to manage my money while I travel, I'll need to get a sim card wherever I go, I'll need an international driving permit, I need VISAs, all my personal documents need to be in date, copied, and backed-up. I need to make sure I've sorted out my taxes, my P45 as I leave my job, and my CV in case I need to apply for another one. It's honestly exhausting, and feels too much like real life, and not enough like a Pinterest board about *wanderlust* and *free spirits* and such.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously a lot of planning comes down to money, and I'm financing myself in several ways-

* I inherited some money. Plain and simple. It's no fortune, but it's enough to cover some flights, and to pay for a second-hand car once I get to Australia.
* I've been saving up! For two years, I've been putting away money with travel in mind.
* I've got working VISAs for the first two legs of my trip (Australia and New Zealand) and enough time in hand that I'm happy to stop and stay in one place for a while, so I can replenish my bank account.
* I'll be sub-letting my flat back in London, which is fairly lucrative.
* I'm going for a lot of ~~more authentic~~ cheaper travel options. Hostels and couch surfing over AirBNBs and hotels. Long overnight coach trips instead of flying. Walking instead of taking the bus. Street food. (IMHO these are the best ways to travel anyway)

I'm fairly confident that my money will take me through to the end of my trip, barring any emergencies. Which brings me on to:

# PSA - Go get yourself checked out head to toe BEFORE heading off alone to the far flung corners of the planet!

Over the past couple of months, I've been to the dentist, psychiatrist, dermatologist, GP and even had a comprehensive sexual health screening (ya girl practices safe sex). 

Now I'm no hypochondriac, and that's more probably more medical appointments than I've had in the past three years combined, but I sure as hell am glad I did it. The only serious problem turned out to be with one of my wisdom teeth. I had no idea at all that anything was wrong, but apparently I would've ended up with a big problem about half a year from now, if it hadn't been nipped in the bud. Imagine making it all the way to the beaches of Fiji, just in time for everything to be ruined because my god damned tooth decides it wants to grow the wrong way out of my skull. *Who would win? The journey of a lifetime, or one enamel boi?*

I know that I can't anticipate an emergency, medical or otherwise. But it's nice to know that I'm setting off with a clean bill of health and no rogue teeth. 

I also decided to spring for insurance. I'm with World Nomads. I haven't used them before, but have got many glowing recommendations from people online and irl. Fingers crossed, the need for insurance won't cross my mind the entire time, and I'll totally forget I even have it. But it makes me feel much better striking out into the unknown, knowing I have a safety net. Plus, when I told my mum I had bought insurance for my trip, she said she was ""Very proud of you, funeral\_slut. That's a very sensible thing to do.""

So there you go.

5441,"Nothing gives an uber-shoestring traveler a more raging hard-on than the opportunity to boast how they travel on some ridiculously insanely low budget.

""Dood...you can travel for like a zillion years on $10,000. I only spend a dollar a day.""

And for some of these people, their boast is actually somewhat true.

Generally missing a few ""Oh, that doesn't get counted in the budget"" details but there are people who absolutely travel the globe on 5 to 10 bucks a day.

The problem is...once you dive deeper down the rabbit hole you find out that:

\- They're couchsurfing or doing WorkAway, HelpX or WOOFing to cut costs.

\- They eat 90% of their meals in the hostel kitchen.

\- They're not ""traveling"" so much as living as an expat somewhere trying to eke out a living as a digital nomad.

\- They forego any and all tourist-priced activities.

\- Perhaps they don't drink, which isn't a crime but is a fact that needs to be clarified.

Or even worse, they're mooching off other travelers or locals.

But even if there's no mooching involved, one way or another their super-hippie travel experience is NOT what your Average Joe traveler is asking about when trying to budget for their first trip.

What they're experiencing is less ""vacation"" and more ""staying alive in a foreign country.""

And that's fine. Do whatever makes you happy.

But realize that when someone's asking about the cost of traveling a month in Thailand, they're probably asking about moving locations every 3-5 days and sometimes eating in a nicer restaurant and sometimes taking a taxi and maybe buying a few gifts and taking a tour now &amp; then and perhaps partying relatively hard once a week.

They're not asking what the cost is to rent a room in Chiang Mai and only eat the cheapest food and mostly entertain yourself with books and Netflix.

They're asking about vacation. 

Share your personal experience but provide meaningful context. 

It's absolute bullshit to say something like, ""You can easily travel SEA for a year with $8,000,"" without meaningful context that describes how your experience varies from what the average traveler is looking for. It's possible to travel for a year on this amount but it's far from easy. 

It's unhelpful to most users asking for advice to be told they can have a great time on some unreasonable amount. While it may be very helpful to describe what you actually get for your $10-15/day.

I've been traveling for well over 20 years now and I've met a million and one super low budget travelers and I'm sorry, in most cases, traveling on an insanely low budget requires missing out. It means staying in to read a book while everyone else goes out. Or it means only having a drink at the bar when someone offers you one. It means passing on activities you'd 100% want to do if someone else was paying. It means not being able to truly experience the local cuisine, and so on.

Again...if this style of travel makes you happy, by all means, shoestring travel away...but don't provide false hopes to those who are clearly looking for a normal budget travel experience. Don't give your budget for scraping by as being comfortable without clarifying what your version of comfortable really means.

&amp;#x200B;

My first night in Dublin sucked. I was tired, jetlagged, and felt entirely uncomfortable in my hostel. When I arrived, I checked in &amp; was given my room - presumably an all female dorm since that's what I booked. Well, they gave me the wrong room &amp; wrong bed. I woke up in the middle of a nap to some random guy telling me to get out of his bed (despite both of us being booked for this bed, he was very rude!) The staff then came in, while I was in a t-shirt and underwear, and explained the mix up. They all left the room &amp; I packed my stuff back up &amp; went to my actual dorm. Nap over (ended up being a blessing as I beat my jetlag that day). I didn't meet anyone in Dublin &amp; the hostel had a weird vibe. I called my boyfriend in tears and told him I was hating being alone and wished that I didn't go. I was being a bit dramatic but I was having such bad anxiety about everything. The next day I went to Edinburgh.. pessimistically. 

&amp;#x200B;

Edinburgh immediately started out better.. perhaps because I was fairly well rested. It was beautiful from the start. I felt comfortable in the city. I got to my hostel (Castle Rock, yay!), unpacked my things, and did some minor walking around myself to get my bearings. I ended up going into the lounge area for cocoa, sitting by some random girl, and we started chatting. We went to dinner, came back, and ended up chatting with another girl... all of us were solo traveling. I spent the next two days exploring Edinburgh on and off with these girls from Brazil and Australia. I started to feel comfortable doing things alone at this point. It was freeing to be able to split off and do our own thing &amp; then meet back up for a drink or dinner. I also got the pleasure of meeting a woman from Pakistan that I taught how to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I did the Isle of Skye tour with Macbackpackers. I was a bit nervous BUT I ended up meeting THREE other solo travelers on my tour! We hungout the entire time.. women from Switzerland, Germany, and Czech Republic. We had dinner when we returned to Edinburgh. I texted saying I didn't feel great and one replied ""okay, I will bring medicine"" &amp; she did! She brought me cold medicine to dinner. How god damn nice is that!? The woman from Germany is coming to the USA to visit me next year... she's already looking at flights... how did I luck out meeting such rad people!?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if I had traveled with friends that I wouldn't have met the amazing people I did. Also, I am not a big drinker and being alone meant I could just sit out when people went to pubs. No pressure to go with. I was uncomfortable at times and being alone was very new but I am so glad I took this trip. Maybe next time I'll try to tackle a non English speaking country but for now it's officially time to head home. :)

5461,"Hi all ! So I'm woman, late twenties and I did my first solo trip this August. I went to Montenegro and overall, I had an amazing time ! I did a lot of hiking (as I LOVE it), swimming, kayaking and visited the main cities.  I was either staying in hostels or camping. 
Nothing major happened (I was mostly anxious about giving the rental car back in one piece to be honest) but I did have a somewhat unpleasant encounter with a man. I was on a mini hike on a late afternoon and crossed paths with a local guy, approximately my age, who decided to come walk with me. At first I thought nothing about it (no red flags at this point) and even thought it would be nice to chat with a local. We struggled to understand each other due to the language barrier but I understood when he asked for my name, where I was from, if I was married, where I was going/staying at, if I would kiss him (yeah it escalated quickly) and if we could just stop and sit together. Apart from introducing myself, I said no to everything/didn't answer and even gestured ""no"" ""stop"" ""go away"" when he tried multiple times to put his arm around my shoulders, grab my hand and whatnot. He did successfully grabbed my face to give me a kiss on the cheek without my consent. I pushed him away, told him it was creepy (again freaking gesturing ""no"" ""stop"") but he just laughed. Not long after that, and after trying to distance him, I lost my nerves when he grabbed me by the shoulders to help me cross a tricky part of the trail but ended up making me loose balance. I got scared for a sec cause we were right on top of a cliff and pissed so I pushed him away again and told him to fucking go. He said ok but just sat like 5 meters away and waited. 
So here I was with a creepy dude who would not leave me alone, in the middle of a forest, beside a cliff, nothing or no one around for the past 45 minutes. I tried not to show that I was feeling unsecure and after catching my breath, I just turned around and walked away fast. He came back running behind me after 15min but finally left me alone when he got tired of following and/or when he noticed a group of people a few meters ahead of us.

Women who solo travel, how do you deal with creepy dudes ?",t5_2rxxm,travel,"Hi all ! So I'm woman, late twenties and I did my first solo trip this August. I went to Montenegro and overall, I had an amazing time ! I did a lot of hiking (as I LOVE it), swimming, kayaking and visited the main cities.  I was either staying in hostels or camping. 
Nothing major happened (I was mostly anxious about giving the rental car back in one piece to be honest) but I did have a somewhat unpleasant encounter with a man. I was on a mini hike on a late afternoon and crossed paths with a local guy, approximately my age, who decided to come walk with me. At first I thought nothing about it (no red flags at this point) and even thought it would be nice to chat with a local. We struggled to understand each other due to the language barrier but I understood when he asked for my name, where I was from, if I was married, where I was going/staying at, if I would kiss him (yeah it escalated quickly) and if we could just stop and sit together. Apart from introducing myself, I said no to everything/didn't answer and even gestured ""no"" ""stop"" ""go away"" when he tried multiple times to put his arm around my shoulders, grab my hand and whatnot. He did successfully grabbed my face to give me a kiss on the cheek without my consent. I pushed him away, told him it was creepy (again freaking gesturing ""no"" ""stop"") but he just laughed. Not long after that, and after trying to distance him, I lost my nerves when he grabbed me by the shoulders to help me cross a tricky part of the trail but ended up making me loose balance. I got scared for a sec cause we were right on top of a cliff and pissed so I pushed him away again and told him to fucking go. He said ok but just sat like 5 meters away and waited. 
So here I was with a creepy dude who would not leave me alone, in the middle of a forest, beside a cliff, nothing or no one around for the past 45 minutes. I tried not to show that I was feeling unsecure and after catching my breath, I just turned around and walked away fast. He came back running behind me after 15min but finally left me alone when he got tired of following and/or when he noticed a group of people a few meters ahead of us.

5466,"I am confused about something and hope you can help me to figure it out because I've been avoiding long-distance bus, which is basically the only real way to travel in some places! I'd like to expand a bit.   


So, when traveling in some parts of the world, like Southeast Asia, the bus rides infamously can be quite long: 16-24 hours is not at all unheard of in Vietnam, Laos, or Myanmar, for example. So far, the longest I've taken was about 7 hours in Cambodia, on a super-tourist bus where English was spoken. Took a few other 6 hour rides in Vietnam too.  


English is often limited, if existent.   


And there are no bathrooms on the bus.   


Sure, they stop once in a while to let you go use the restroom, but when you've got to go, you've got to go! Sometimes you don't know how long you have to wait, and the last bus ride I took, honestly, I considered pissing in my pants. I was in a Vietnamese sleeper bus, upper deck, with people packing the aisles, and no one spoke a word of English. Finally we stopped, finally, for ten minutes, and I was overjoyed to pee in what amounted to the back of someone's house.  


If you're stuck on a long, local bus, especially overnight, and have to pee, but no one speaks the language, what do you do? Short of wearing adult diapers and never drinking fluids at all?  


Clue me in about how you handle this one? Thanks. I kind of need to take a sleeper bus for 20 hours through Myanmar, and I'm even worse at night, when I wake up and just plain gotta go, right then.

So some backstory:. I've been traveling off and on for over five years now, working and living in hostels in multiple countries.

I find that while I enjoy the free rent and general comradery of being in a hostel long term, for me the most difficult thing is the lack of privacy.  The hostel I'm in right now is HUGE, like three floors with probably over a hundred people in it.

  The good thing is they have private bathrooms with attached showers, and occasionally I'll just lock myself in one of the bathrooms for even twenty minutes to escape the people, the noise and to just let my brain recharge.  I don't want to o hear any other language other than English, I don't want to socialize, I just want to breathe.

I just want to reiterate that I LOVE my coworkers, I love the vibe of the current place I'm in, but goddamn it gets taxing on my brain when there's a hundred people and a dozen languages and its raining outside so I can't sit in the park and I just need a minute......

5471,"So a couple months ago I decided I wanted to travel by myself for the first time, and for some reason I really wanted it to be the US. Since a majority of Reddit is from there I posted here and asked what people really wanted me to see, and the comments did not disappoint, I got so many of them and I took them all in consideration. Even though I didn't plan a thing, I just went and hoped everything would go well.

So on May 15th it was finally there, my first solo trip, I flew from Amsterdam to New York and I loved it, mostly because it was my first time there, and I hadn't seen anything from the US yet. 

I stayed there for a week before going to Boston, which was nice, but I didn't do much, my hostel was quite far out of the city and there were a lot of nice people I met in the hostel to just chill with and enjoy the weather. 

After three nights I flew to DC which was then my favorite city, I loved the monuments, the museums and how clean the city was, again the people in the hostel were great and even the owner of the hostel was a great guy. 

Next up: Miami, which was a totally different world, from sightseeing and taking photos almost everyday to chilling at the beach during the day and binge drinking and going out at night. It was a lot of fun though and I enjoyed my time there a lot, South Beach treated me right, my favorite part of Miami must've been Wynwood, Art District. 

After Miami I had no clue where to go next, I checked Skyscanner, and without hesitation I booked my flight to the Bahamas, the flight was cheap, my hostel was kinda cheap but so beautiful, and at an amazing location, however... My stay at the Bahamas was absolutely horrible. First off, the bus driver from the airport just dropped me off in the middle of nowhere, so I had to walk 2 hours with both my bags in this killing heat, and the second problem I had there were the people who were also staying at the hostel.. it was the first time I felt alone, because no one was talking to each other, and even if I tried to start a conversation they were just not interested and it really killed the experience, all I did was enjoy the weather and the beautiful location by myself.

My flight back was to Miami again, but since I had already been there I didn't plan on staying so as soon as I landed I took a bus to Orlando, not for the parks but just because I didn't know where to go, I found this very nice Airbnb on the way there in Kissimmee, a small 30 minutes out of Orlando, the nicest Airbnb I had ever seen, Cabana City. This guy set up 10 cabanas in his garden (which was huge) all around a hot tub, they were very comfortable and the owner of the place was a great guy, I did some wine tasting at the Lakeridge Winery but that was about it, I mostly enjoyed the pool because it was just too hot out there.

Then my first experience with Amtrak came along; Orlando to Charleston, SC. And this city will be my favorite city in the US forever, there is no way anything can beat the charm of this old looking, and welcoming little town. If I ever have to move to the US, this would be the place I want to live, the people, the food, the architecture, the weather, everything about it was just amazing, and I wish I had planned a little more time here, but after a few days I already had a flight to Austin, TX.

Austin was fun from the second I walked into my hostel, without planning this out, I met someone who I also met in Miami and he was a great guy, we hung around for a few days and enjoyed 6th St at night, before he had to leave again on his roadtrip in the car he bought in Miami. The last days in Austin were just chilled, some paddleboarding on the river next to the hostel and just listening to the music some of the other guests were making on their guitars.

New Orleans was my next stop (I stayed in Houston for one night because it was the cheaper option) and New Orleans was great, a bit to hot because of the humidity which made sightseeing a hell, but the overall experience was amazing.

And then California: I flew from New Orleans to LA to just stay there for one night, after that night I'd go to San Diego where I met a lot of great people, even though it was just like Miami, just beachdays and beers, we still managed to go on a walking tour in Tijuana, which was in my opinion too touristy, I did not really have the feeling I was in Mexico, but still, another country I can tick off on the list. When I got back in the hostel, the roadtripping guy from Miami had just arrived and was playing some beerpong, and I was so confused. The other times he offered me to come  with him on the trip, but I unfortunately already had other things booked when he asked me, but this time that was not the case so I decided to join him, which was the best decision of my life!

From San Diego to Santa Monica, for 3 nights, and one of them was the 4th of July, a dream come true, celebrating Independence day in Santa Monica. Hollywood was our next stop, but LA got hit with a heatwave and it was not possible to leave the cold areas where an AC was working his ass off. At nights it cooled down a little so that's when we did most of our sightseeing, the Walk of Fame, and the Hollywood sign were basically all we saw there. 

Vegas was a complete surprise for me because they told me they had an Airbnb booked where I could stay with them, (it was me and 6 others at this point) however this Airbnb turned out to be a suite on the 12th floor of the MGM Grand and it was such a weird experience to be in a place like that for once. I had my reasons not to gamble in LV so I mostly enjoyed the clubs there but in the end it was a great experience. 

Since this was my first time with ""my own"" vehicle I was finally able to see some natural parks which I what we did, first the Grand Canyon and then Yosemite. And at this point I already regret not having my own car for the whole trip, because I would've done only national parks from that point, I didn't expect it to be this beautiful out there, but it was amazing to camp in nature and I cannot thank my friend enough for taking me with him.

Unfortunately.. on the way from Yosemite to San Francisco the car broke down, so we had to take a train to San Fran and that's where our trip together ended, they had to go back to get the car and I went to Sacramento and Portland, in Sacramento I got to stay with a friend I knew from my first week in NYC so that was very convenient, I love how friendly everyone I met was when I told them I was coming to their city. 

Getting to Portland was a hell, an 18 hour train got delayed, so it turned out to be a 23 hour trip.. but I finally got there, so that was a good thing. In Portland I wanted to see some film locations of my favorite TV-Show; Grimm, and it did not disappoint. However that was only one day in a 4 day stay so I had no clue what to do the other days. But because Portland was so beautiful there was plenty I could do around there, like enjoying nature and going on the aerial tram to enjoy the view.

Seattle is mostly known for Starbucks I guess, and since I'm not a huge fan of coffee, what was I supposed to do there, well a local I met over Tinder (the only reason I was on tinder in the US was to meet locals who could show me around) knew exactly what. The insane looking library is where we met, she then showed me the gum wall (in my opinion this was just disgusting) and then we took a ferry to the other side of the Sound, on the ferry back I really enjoyed the skyline of Seattle and that view got even better when at night she introduced me to her friends and we had some beers on a hill with an even better view over the city. Thanks for this great day!

Since I was so close to the border, I had to go to Canada, so Vancouver was the place. With only 2 weeks on my trip left and my final destination New York, I kinda got tired of doing so much sightseeing so in Vancouver I just went to a soccermatch; Vancouver Whitecaps 4 - Minnesota United 2. I was supposed to meet a friend from home in Vancouver but he got delayed so he would get here after I already left.

Because of my ESTA I was not able to fly in or out of Canada so I had to go back to Seattle to then fly to Chicago, where I had another friend (also from my time in NYC) who I wanted to meet up with, the first few nights I was staying in a hostel, which was way too luxurious to be a hostel, but it was. The weekend came though and this weekend was the Lollapalooza festival, and the prizes of the hostels went up like crazy, so my friend offered me to stay on his couch for a few nights, he showed me his favorite places and I got to see a whole other side of Chicago. 

In Toronto I wanted to visit another friend, this time one I made in San Diego, and she introduced me to her friends who were all very interested in my trip and invited me over to a very special party; a player of the DC Capitals who won the Stanley Cup had a private party for friends and family, and this was probably the best night of my life. I had no clue how I ended up there but it was amazing!

Montreal was just another stop to kill the time, only a few days left before I would head home so I just walked around the city a bit, tried some food and drank with some fellow guests, funny enough the Miami/Austin/San Diego/Roadtrip guy was in Montreal with his parents now, so I joined them for lunch and we told them this crazy story.

My last stop before New York was Philadelphia where I stayed at my friend's place again, I met him in Miami and we were both really into soccer so that's what we did, watch some soccer on TV. He was also a great tour guide since he showed me more of Philly then I expected to see in the two days I was there. 

There was no other place where I could stay my last night in the US than the first hostel I stayed in 3 months ago, so that's what I did, I was tired so all I did was just chill at the hostel and watch some Netflix. 

Happy to go home.

Since a majority of Reddit is from there I posted here and asked what people really wanted me to see, and the comments did not disappoint, I got so many of them and I took them all in consideration. Even though I didn't plan a thing, I just went and hoped everything would go well.

So on May 15th it was finally there, my first solo trip, I flew from Amsterdam to New York and I loved it, mostly because it was my first time there, and I hadn't seen anything from the US yet. 

I stayed there for a week before going to Boston, which was nice, but I didn't do much, my hostel was quite far out of the city and there were a lot of nice people I met in the hostel to just chill with and enjoy the weather. 

After three nights I flew to DC which was then my favorite city, I loved the monuments, the museums and how clean the city was, again the people in the hostel were great and even the owner of the hostel was a great guy. 

Next up: Miami, which was a totally different world, from sightseeing and taking photos almost everyday to chilling at the beach during the day and binge drinking and going out at night. It was a lot of fun though and I enjoyed my time there a lot, South Beach treated me right, my favorite part of Miami must've been Wynwood, Art District. 

After Miami I had no clue where to go next, I checked Skyscanner, and without hesitation I booked my flight to the Bahamas, the flight was cheap, my hostel was kinda cheap but so beautiful, and at an amazing location, however... My stay at the Bahamas was absolutely horrible. First off, the bus driver from the airport just dropped me off in the middle of nowhere, so I had to walk 2 hours with both my bags in this killing heat, and the second problem I had there were the people who were also staying at the hostel.. it was the first time I felt alone, because no one was talking to each other, and even if I tried to start a conversation they were just not interested and it really killed the experience, all I did was enjoy the weather and the beautiful location by myself.

My flight back was to Miami again, but since I had already been there I didn't plan on staying so as soon as I landed I took a bus to Orlando, not for the parks but just because I didn't know where to go, I found this very nice Airbnb on the way there in Kissimmee, a small 30 minutes out of Orlando, the nicest Airbnb I had ever seen, Cabana City. This guy set up 10 cabanas in his garden (which was huge) all around a hot tub, they were very comfortable and the owner of the place was a great guy, I did some wine tasting at the Lakeridge Winery but that was about it, I mostly enjoyed the pool because it was just too hot out there.

Then my first experience with Amtrak came along; Orlando to Charleston, SC. And this city will be my favorite city in the US forever, there is no way anything can beat the charm of this old looking, and welcoming little town. If I ever have to move to the US, this would be the place I want to live, the people, the food, the architecture, the weather, everything about it was just amazing, and I wish I had planned a little more time here, but after a few days I already had a flight to Austin, TX.

Austin was fun from the second I walked into my hostel, without planning this out, I met someone who I also met in Miami and he was a great guy, we hung around for a few days and enjoyed 6th St at night, before he had to leave again on his roadtrip in the car he bought in Miami. The last days in Austin were just chilled, some paddleboarding on the river next to the hostel and just listening to the music some of the other guests were making on their guitars.

New Orleans was my next stop (I stayed in Houston for one night because it was the cheaper option) and New Orleans was great, a bit to hot because of the humidity which made sightseeing a hell, but the overall experience was amazing.

And then California: I flew from New Orleans to LA to just stay there for one night, after that night I'd go to San Diego where I met a lot of great people, even though it was just like Miami, just beachdays and beers, we still managed to go on a walking tour in Tijuana, which was in my opinion too touristy, I did not really have the feeling I was in Mexico, but still, another country I can tick off on the list. When I got back in the hostel, the roadtripping guy from Miami had just arrived and was playing some beerpong, and I was so confused. The other times he offered me to come  with him on the trip, but I unfortunately already had other things booked when he asked me, but this time that was not the case so I decided to join him, which was the best decision of my life!

From San Diego to Santa Monica, for 3 nights, and one of them was the 4th of July, a dream come true, celebrating Independence day in Santa Monica. Hollywood was our next stop, but LA got hit with a heatwave and it was not possible to leave the cold areas where an AC was working his ass off. At nights it cooled down a little so that's when we did most of our sightseeing, the Walk of Fame, and the Hollywood sign were basically all we saw there. 

Vegas was a complete surprise for me because they told me they had an Airbnb booked where I could stay with them, (it was me and 6 others at this point) however this Airbnb turned out to be a suite on the 12th floor of the MGM Grand and it was such a weird experience to be in a place like that for once. I had my reasons not to gamble in LV so I mostly enjoyed the clubs there but in the end it was a great experience. 

Since this was my first time with ""my own"" vehicle I was finally able to see some natural parks which I what we did, first the Grand Canyon and then Yosemite. And at this point I already regret not having my own car for the whole trip, because I would've done only national parks from that point, I didn't expect it to be this beautiful out there, but it was amazing to camp in nature and I cannot thank my friend enough for taking me with him.

Unfortunately.. on the way from Yosemite to San Francisco the car broke down, so we had to take a train to San Fran and that's where our trip together ended, they had to go back to get the car and I went to Sacramento and Portland, in Sacramento I got to stay with a friend I knew from my first week in NYC so that was very convenient, I love how friendly everyone I met was when I told them I was coming to their city. 

Getting to Portland was a hell, an 18 hour train got delayed, so it turned out to be a 23 hour trip.. but I finally got there, so that was a good thing. In Portland I wanted to see some film locations of my favorite TV-Show; Grimm, and it did not disappoint. However that was only one day in a 4 day stay so I had no clue what to do the other days. But because Portland was so beautiful there was plenty I could do around there, like enjoying nature and going on the aerial tram to enjoy the view.

Seattle is mostly known for Starbucks I guess, and since I'm not a huge fan of coffee, what was I supposed to do there, well a local I met over Tinder (the only reason I was on tinder in the US was to meet locals who could show me around) knew exactly what. The insane looking library is where we met, she then showed me the gum wall (in my opinion this was just disgusting) and then we took a ferry to the other side of the Sound, on the ferry back I really enjoyed the skyline of Seattle and that view got even better when at night she introduced me to her friends and we had some beers on a hill with an even better view over the city. Thanks for this great day!

Since I was so close to the border, I had to go to Canada, so Vancouver was the place. With only 2 weeks on my trip left and my final destination New York, I kinda got tired of doing so much sightseeing so in Vancouver I just went to a soccermatch; Vancouver Whitecaps 4 - Minnesota United 2. I was supposed to meet a friend from home in Vancouver but he got delayed so he would get here after I already left.

Because of my ESTA I was not able to fly in or out of Canada so I had to go back to Seattle to then fly to Chicago, where I had another friend (also from my time in NYC) who I wanted to meet up with, the first few nights I was staying in a hostel, which was way too luxurious to be a hostel, but it was. The weekend came though and this weekend was the Lollapalooza festival, and the prizes of the hostels went up like crazy, so my friend offered me to stay on his couch for a few nights, he showed me his favorite places and I got to see a whole other side of Chicago. 

In Toronto I wanted to visit another friend, this time one I made in San Diego, and she introduced me to her friends who were all very interested in my trip and invited me over to a very special party; a player of the DC Capitals who won the Stanley Cup had a private party for friends and family, and this was probably the best night of my life. I had no clue how I ended up there but it was amazing!

Montreal was just another stop to kill the time, only a few days left before I would head home so I just walked around the city a bit, tried some food and drank with some fellow guests, funny enough the Miami/Austin/San Diego/Roadtrip guy was in Montreal with his parents now, so I joined them for lunch and we told them this crazy story.

My last stop before New York was Philadelphia where I stayed at my friend's place again, I met him in Miami and we were both really into soccer so that's what we did, watch some soccer on TV. He was also a great tour guide since he showed me more of Philly then I expected to see in the two days I was there. 

There was no other place where I could stay my last night in the US than the first hostel I stayed in 3 months ago, so that's what I did, I was tired so all I did was just chill at the hostel and watch some Netflix. 

Happy to go home.

I am planning to travel to Beijing at the beginning of September. I was supposed to stay with my friend who lives in Beijing with her mom. I expected her to help me with navigating and speaking in Beijing. 

Come to find out that she has a business trip and will be gone by the time I get there. I will still be staying with her mom, but her mom doesn’t speak any English. And I don’t speak mandarin. 

So I will be visiting and sightseeing solo, and trying to get around Beijing with little to no mandarin. I’m teaching myself the basic phrases now. This will be my first time solo traveling and being in a foreign city basically by myself. Since this wasn’t planned to be so solo, I am freaking out!

Any advice on navigating the Beijing life, and solo traveling in general? 

P.S. I am a black female , and I know there’s not many of those in China. That also makes me nervous.

5478,"I love the freedom and flexibility of solo travel but I love having the opportunity to spend segments of my trips with friends, too.

5480," So this was my (20F) first ever solo travel trip and first ever time out of Europe. I was on the beautiful Gili Trawangan island, near north Lombok. My family were very worried about me solo travelling anyway as they tend not to travel often. I reassured them of how I'd be staying in hostels, meeting people and generally staying in safe places. That I'd be careful and I'd be fine. Lots of people solo travel. Asia is the perfect place to do it. I didn't expect to be in a magnitude 7 earthquake. 

I posted on this subreddit a couple times before, you may or may not have seen - once for advice about my first solo travel trip and another post about how happy I was that I had done it and how great my first night of the trip was in Bangkok. My month of solo travel was definitely one of the most amazing months of my life, but also, as you can imagine, I had the most intense, terrifying and eye opening moment of my life whilst there. This obviously was not something I was expecting to happen. I had read a lot in preparation about the highs and lows of solo travel - I didn't expect my low point to be being in the earthquake and genuinely believing I was going to die, but it taught me a lot and it took me out of the bubble I had been in. I am so lucky to have a safe home to go back to but this is so sadly not the case for many locals. And it's not fair. 

When you hear about earthquakes and natural disasters in the news you never think it will happen to you. They’re so unlikely. Happen rarely. You feel invincible and like it’s a thing that just happens in other places to other people. 

At around 8pm on Sunday the 5th of August I was sat in my hostel room with some people I had met, we were chatting and listening to music. Out of nowhere the ground start shaking slightly and we all looked around puzzled and asked each other, ""what's that?"". Suddenly the shakes turned into uncontrollable rocking side to side of the huge concrete walls, with the concrete roof swaying vigorously above our heads. The electricity went out. We were in darkness. A loud roar was erupting from the ground, it sounded like thunder. Standing up was almost impossible. The shaking was getting worse. I could hear crashes and bangs outside - buildings were collapsing. People were screaming. I remember so vividly the moment of realising what was happening - this is an earthquake. I’m in a concrete building. The exit is too far. I’m going to die. An indescribable sadness filled my body as I thought of my family and all the things I wanted to do with my life that I hadn't yet done. 

Adrenaline took over and we ran outside into the open space of the hostel. Luckily this building was strong. If it had been weaker like most of the surrounding ones I’m not sure the roof would have stayed up above my head.

Everyone was in shock, shaking and terrified. No one knew what to do. Eventually it stopped and our hostel instructed us to run to the open field so we did in the darkness through the streets, avoiding the collapsed walls and hoping the ground wouldn’t start to shake again whilst we were amongst them. I was wearing just a t shirt and pants. No shoes or socks. I didn't want to go back to get my phone.

When we got to the fields there were crowds of terrified adults and children, locals and tourists, hugging and screaming. People were injured. Every 20ish minutes afterwards there would be an aftershock - a smaller earthquake where the ground would rock and feel like it was ‘erupting’ again. It felt fluid and unstable. How could something that's always so definitely solid feel so fluid? The earth is bigger and more powerful than we ever will realise. This world we live on and our own lives could change at any moment in a moment and we overestimate the consistency and safety of this not happening in our comfortable little bubbles. I was questioning everything I knew. Everything I believed. What will happen to me if this is my last moment on earth? My whole body was in shock and fear just as everyone else’s was and I still was covered in the feeling that I’m going to die tonight.

People were frantically refreshing their phones for updates then started to notice there were possible tsunami threats. My heart almost stopped when I heard that. I was on a small island - it takes just an hour to walk around, surrounded completely by the sea. So we ran to the top of the hill, the highest point of land on the island. I was bare foot and next day realised it was a 15 minute walk away but this part of my memory blacked out and it felt like I ran there in 30 seconds. I remember hearing the murmurs of ""the tsunami is coming"" from people also running to the hill. This was all so surreal. 

The hill was covered in thousands of people in the darkness all terrified. Groups were praying. Local hostel staff gave me a blanket so I could keep warm. They were so kind. Aftershocks kept happening and everyone would scream. We all watched in the distance for a tsunami. I borrowed someone’s phone to message my family and tell them I love them. People were shouting and crying asking for doctors help. Eventually the tsunami threat was lifted/wasn’t official.

I ‘slept’ (I couldn’t sleep) under the stars that night at the top of the hill. They were so bright. I've never seen so many shooting stars. The lack of electricity on the island illuminated the sky. I kept hearing locals prayers and I'd question again, what do I believe in? What happens to me now? 

When the sun finally rose after a terrifying night we made our way back to the hostel where a lot of the guests were sat on beanbags outside. The walk back was extremely sad - seeing the damage of the earthquake. It was previously masked by the fear and the night but now it was all becoming very real. The destroyed homes and shops and lives. All right there. This paradise island was like a ghost town. I remember though some locals smiling at me and saying good morning. They were so lovely despite all that had happened. A guy in my hostel said he moved a collapsed wall to find a girl and her farther dead but the mom still alive.

Everyone was trying to leave the island - thousands of people trying to get on boats and there few spaces for them all. People were getting into fights to get on the boats. Those injured by the earthquake got priority and then the locals and as there were less and less of them people began to loot the shops. Supplies such as food and water were running out so people were breaking into wherever they could to get it.

We didn’t manage to leave that day so went back to the hostel that night as we thought it’s safer to be there than wait in a crowd on the beach if there was another earthquake. The aftershocks continued but the hostel were so amazing with keeping everyone calm. The bar and kitchen was open for anyone to use what they want and we played music and drank. We all cooked for each other and were all there for each other. This was such a raw feeling of humanity. 

The next morning we left to get the boat - there were reports of people who had waited on the beach being robbed and raped. We were waiting for a direct boat to Bali but only boats to Lombok were arriving (where the earthquake epicentre was). It felt unsafe to get closer to the earthquake but we needed to leave the island so eventually caught a boat the government had sent then got transport through Lombok to their southern port and at 5pm, eventually caught a slow boat to Bali. As we drove through Lombok the coach was in silence as we looked out at the devastating remains. What I saw was something I will never forget. I'd seen footage similar on the news before for other natural disasters. But now I was really there. This was all really happening. This is real. Only when I was there in person did I realise the extent of such devastation and how sad it truly is. These disasters are real. They are more than just news reports. They are more than just something to think is sad then continue your day back in your safe home away from it all and not think about again. That's what I used to do. We arrived at 11pm in Bali in the pouring rain but were happy to be alive and in a relatively safer place. I was happy to feel the rain fall on me. Everything felt like it was glistening. I was alive.

Gili T and Lombok are beautiful islands with some of the most beautifully kindhearted locals. I am lucky to be able to return to a safe home soon but for most that isn’t the case. I can’t imagine the feeling of having lost family members in this disaster without a safe place to go back to. Or having lost your business. Everything you own and have worked for.

The moment we were all sat on that hill really put life into perspective. We are all human. None of us want to die. None of us get to choose to be born in a safe or rich place.

The kindness and togetherness I felt will never leave my heart. I can’t believe what happened and I really hope those incredible places with incredible people will be okay.

Next time you see a natural disaster on the news remember it’s a real place with real people. If I had gone for a walk in the moment the earthquake happened, which I so easily could’ve done as of course no one was expecting an earthquake, I could’ve died. As many others did. I’m so lucky to have been in the right place. I’m still in so much shock. But so happy to be ok. Please support places in natural disasters if you can afford to because these places need it more that £5 you may spend on a drink at the pub. Donating a little goes a long way in these situations so if we can afford to we should. We have nothing to lose by doing so. These are real tragedies and more than just a shocking report on the news.

What you read doesn’t sum up what it’s really like to be there in the moment. And I don’t think any of us can imagine what it’s like to be a local there who has lost things that are so important to them.

I was wearing just a t shirt and pants. No shoes or socks. I didn't want to go back to get my phone.

When we got to the fields there were crowds of terrified adults and children, locals and tourists, hugging and screaming. People were injured. Every 20ish minutes afterwards there would be an aftershock - a smaller earthquake where the ground would rock and feel like it was ‘erupting’ again. It felt fluid and unstable. How could something that's always so definitely solid feel so fluid? The earth is bigger and more powerful than we ever will realise. This world we live on and our own lives could change at any moment in a moment and we overestimate the consistency and safety of this not happening in our comfortable little bubbles. I was questioning everything I knew. Everything I believed. What will happen to me if this is my last moment on earth? My whole body was in shock and fear just as everyone else’s was and I still was covered in the feeling that I’m going to die tonight.

People were frantically refreshing their phones for updates then started to notice there were possible tsunami threats. My heart almost stopped when I heard that. I was on a small island - it takes just an hour to walk around, surrounded completely by the sea. So we ran to the top of the hill, the highest point of land on the island. I was bare foot and next day realised it was a 15 minute walk away but this part of my memory blacked out and it felt like I ran there in 30 seconds. I remember hearing the murmurs of ""the tsunami is coming"" from people also running to the hill. This was all so surreal. 

The hill was covered in thousands of people in the darkness all terrified. Groups were praying. Local hostel staff gave me a blanket so I could keep warm. They were so kind. Aftershocks kept happening and everyone would scream. We all watched in the distance for a tsunami. I borrowed someone’s phone to message my family and tell them I love them. People were shouting and crying asking for doctors help. Eventually the tsunami threat was lifted/wasn’t official.

I ‘slept’ (I couldn’t sleep) under the stars that night at the top of the hill. They were so bright. I've never seen so many shooting stars. The lack of electricity on the island illuminated the sky. I kept hearing locals prayers and I'd question again, what do I believe in? What happens to me now? 

When the sun finally rose after a terrifying night we made our way back to the hostel where a lot of the guests were sat on beanbags outside. The walk back was extremely sad - seeing the damage of the earthquake. It was previously masked by the fear and the night but now it was all becoming very real. The destroyed homes and shops and lives. All right there. This paradise island was like a ghost town. I remember though some locals smiling at me and saying good morning. They were so lovely despite all that had happened. A guy in my hostel said he moved a collapsed wall to find a girl and her farther dead but the mom still alive.

Everyone was trying to leave the island - thousands of people trying to get on boats and there few spaces for them all. People were getting into fights to get on the boats. Those injured by the earthquake got priority and then the locals and as there were less and less of them people began to loot the shops. Supplies such as food and water were running out so people were breaking into wherever they could to get it.

We didn’t manage to leave that day so went back to the hostel that night as we thought it’s safer to be there than wait in a crowd on the beach if there was another earthquake. The aftershocks continued but the hostel were so amazing with keeping everyone calm. The bar and kitchen was open for anyone to use what they want and we played music and drank. We all cooked for each other and were all there for each other. This was such a raw feeling of humanity. 

The next morning we left to get the boat - there were reports of people who had waited on the beach being robbed and raped. We were waiting for a direct boat to Bali but only boats to Lombok were arriving (where the earthquake epicentre was). It felt unsafe to get closer to the earthquake but we needed to leave the island so eventually caught a boat the government had sent then got transport through Lombok to their southern port and at 5pm, eventually caught a slow boat to Bali. As we drove through Lombok the coach was in silence as we looked out at the devastating remains. What I saw was something I will never forget. I'd seen footage similar on the news before for other natural disasters. But now I was really there. This was all really happening. This is real. Only when I was there in person did I realise the extent of such devastation and how sad it truly is. These disasters are real. They are more than just news reports. They are more than just something to think is sad then continue your day back in your safe home away from it all and not think about again. That's what I used to do. We arrived at 11pm in Bali in the pouring rain but were happy to be alive and in a relatively safer place. I was happy to feel the rain fall on me. Everything felt like it was glistening. I was alive.

Gili T and Lombok are beautiful islands with some of the most beautifully kindhearted locals. I am lucky to be able to return to a safe home soon but for most that isn’t the case. I can’t imagine the feeling of having lost family members in this disaster without a safe place to go back to. Or having lost your business. Everything you own and have worked for.

The moment we were all sat on that hill really put life into perspective. We are all human. None of us want to die. None of us get to choose to be born in a safe or rich place.

The kindness and togetherness I felt will never leave my heart. I can’t believe what happened and I really hope those incredible places with incredible people will be okay.

Next time you see a natural disaster on the news remember it’s a real place with real people. If I had gone for a walk in the moment the earthquake happened, which I so easily could’ve done as of course no one was expecting an earthquake, I could’ve died. As many others did. I’m so lucky to have been in the right place. I’m still in so much shock. But so happy to be ok. Please support places in natural disasters if you can afford to because these places need it more that £5 you may spend on a drink at the pub. Donating a little goes a long way in these situations so if we can afford to we should. We have nothing to lose by doing so. These are real tragedies and more than just a shocking report on the news.

What you read doesn’t sum up what it’s really like to be there in the moment. And I don’t think any of us can imagine what it’s like to be a local there who has lost things that are so important to them.",My first solo trip and being in the Lombok earthquake,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/98e6pt/my_first_solo_trip_and_being_in_the_lombok/

5483,"I'll try to keep this short. Long time lurker, first time poster.

My last real vacation was in 2011. 2017 was crap, lots of personal downfalls, so I decided to travel solo to Europe for 2 weeks this summer.

Went to Vienna, Prague, and Berlin between June 27 and July 9.

I'm 37M and I was always a bit of an introvert, for this trip I wanted to get out of my comfort zone. What really helped me was 4 things that I hope are not too cheesy to share:

* Reach out to long forgotten friends (or friends of friends) in the cities you're visiting, they will most likely be more than happy to meet you for a drink or a walk. It helped me in Vienna and Berlin, and just by accident I discovered that my cousin lives in Berlin thanks to Facebook's Nearby Friends feature.

* Check out Airbnb Experiences and Couchsurfing for people to hangout with or do cool stuff. I signed up for a private dinner at someone's house through Airbnb and it was lots of fun.

* Check out dating apps like Tinder. Yes I know what most people use it for but be honest. I created a profile and said *I'm in Prague for 2 days, want to meet someone who can show me the city, make a new friend, and nothing more!* I ended up meeting someone really fun who showed me hidden parts of the city.

* Lastly, and I can't stress this enough, always smile! Trust me it makes a world of a difference.

I think I used the above as my safety net for not feeling lonely, and honestly even though I was doing lots of stuff solo 75% of the time, I never felt lonely, these activities just made my trip more fun.

5484,"So all my life I’ve been a natural introvert, so it was only a mater of time before I did a real solo trip. 85% of my life is spent doing mostly solo activities, with a bit of time left for my best friend. A few years ago, I was really depressed and down about my life. I was living with family (who can be quite demanding) and busting my ass in grad school. It all became too much this last semester so I decided so get as far away from my home as possible for at least a month. 

I was accepted into a study abroad program in Israel back in May that would last 3 weeks long. After that, I was also accepted to a funded residency program in Jerusalem for another month. I decided that I would take an additional trip to Athens as well, since it was pretty close and the tickets were inexpensive. 

My 3-week long study aboard program was actually the most taxing, because I spent a lot of my time around other people (which for me is a lot). The internship was a blessing, not only because I got to work overseas and earn money, but also because I had my own dorm room and had a lot of time for self reflection. 

After the internship, I spent a day in Tel Aviv at a hostel where I met a few interesting people by chance and we all had drinks. Currently, I’m in Athens at my hotel where it has been a true blast! I’ve gotten to see all the sights I wanted and eaten the best seafood. I have to go back to Tel Aviv to catch my flight back to the US so I get to see more stuff there. 

I think what’s scary about traveling solo is just trying to survive on your own and dealing with your own brain (thoughts, emotions, fears, etc.). So many times, our society pushes this idea that being alone is somehow bad or undesirable. When in actuality, it’s the time you grow as a person and figure out what you really want. Back home I’m always bombarded with task, opinions, and concerns from family, friends, teachers, etc. But here I am only responsible for myself. 

And this is not all to say that there weren’t times I didn’t feel lonely or depressed. I just didn’t internalize those feeling to the point were it out weighed my gratitude for my chance to really travel. We all have an amazing opportunity to see things most people would kill for, and I’ll take loneliness as a result of that any day. 

I have a better grasp of what I want to change about my life back home to make it better for ME. Not my family, not my friends, not my teachers, me. I’m very excited now. Some people will be angry with the choices I’ve made while I’ve been here, but such is life. I’m tired of not living for myself and this trip taught me that. 

Looking at this sub before the trip really gave me hope that solo travel was definitely a worthwhile thing, and for that I thank you all.

5492,"Hi everyone! 

I actually wasn't sure if I should post this or not, because re-reading it, I sound quite hysterical and uninformed. But there's no thread about men warding off women's unwanted advances going on right now, so... maybe this does warrant a discussion. 

I'm brand new to solo travel and have not left my (quite safe) continent yet. There are lots of ""exotic"" destinations on my bucket list and I'd like to try a more adventurous approach to travelling, but I have some fears holding me back. 

There's no way not to sound conceited with what I'm about to say next, so I'll just spit it out: I feel that, as a woman, one has the constant threat of sexual violence looming over oneself, something that men experience in a lower degree statistically. No, I don't think I'm that attractive that every foreign man hopes to have a chance with me, I certainly wouldn't flirt with myself, but I have had enough unpleasant experiences, both abroad and in my home country, to know that it's a possibility. 

I hate feeling this way, because lots of people back home are surprised and worried by my (actually really tame and touristy) solo travels and I want to demonstrate that women can do anything. I read lots of travel testimonies, written by people of both genders, but sometimes, when I listen to mens' experiences, I can't help but think that I could never do the things they did. I vividly remember a man writing about how he walked through seedy parts of Mexico City without being scared because he didn't have any money to be robbed, and well, a woman would maybe have other concerns that wouldn't be solved by just being broke. See also, the nonchalance with which couchsurfing is always recommended. 

I know that there's nothing to worry about statistically, that bad things can happen everywhere, that it's important to always be aware of one's surroundings etc. But when I think about some of my dream destinations (Morocco, Peru, Chile, Egypt etc.), I can't shake the feeling that I have to take extra precautions that a man wouldn't have to take, and it makes me very angry. 

I know I just sounded like a hysterical old lady who thinks every foreign country is unsafe.
